TBI : Shooting at Savannah party leaves 4 injured
 SAVANNAH , Tenn. — Bullets broke up a party at the Hardin County Fairgrounds Saturday in Savannah , leaving several people injured .
 “
Everything was going good , they were playing music and everyone was having a good time , ” Savannah resident Charles Ross said .

But the party quickly took a turn for the worse .

The TBI said just before midnight , Savannah police officers responded to a report of a shooting on the fairground property .
 “
When officers arrived at the scene , they did find several individuals that had gunshot injuries , ” Susan Niland , public information officer for the TBI said .
Two victims were transported to a local hospital and two more to a hospital in Memphis .
There is no word on the condition of the victims , but Niland said more information will be released when available .

People in the area said it ’s not uncommon for someone to rent out a building at the fairgrounds for a gathering or party .
The TBI said at least 100 people were at the party Saturday night when shots were fired .

Charles Ross said he wasn’t at the party , but his daughter was the host .

He said although no suspects have been identified at this time , he believes whoever is responsible for opening fire wasn’t from the area .

“ I don’t think anybody involved in the shooting was from here , ” he said .
They come from different places like McNaiy county and Jackson .
He says the shooting has residents on edge and hopes to see the whoever responsible in custody soon .

When people come to visit , I tell them its a retirement town because it ’s usually so quiet , ” he said.”But then this other stuff started going on .
The TBI said this is still an active investigation and asks anyone with information about this shooting to call them .
