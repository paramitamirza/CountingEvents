10-year - old girl shot in head through living room window - WMC Action News 5 - Memphis , Tennessee
A 10-year - old girl was shot in the head when a bullet flew through the window of her house .

Memphis police officers said the shooting happened in the Goodwill Village Apartments , which are located in the 2500 block of Goodwill Lane , just before 9 p.m. Monday .

Dobbs ' father said an argument outside their apartment led to the shooting , but his daughter , Vynnitra Dobbs , was not the intended target .
Vincent Dobbs said a man approached him and said he did n't belong there .

“ I threw my hands up , because I knew he had a gun , ”
Dobbs said .
“ I 'm not from North Memphis .
I 'm not , but I should have the right to stay where I want to stay . ”

Dobbs said he and the other man both walked away , but he later heard gunfire .
When he walked inside , he found the broken window and his daughter bleeding on the living room floor .

" When I got around there , her mom and my daughter , she was holding her to her telling her to wake up , " Dobbs said .
“ She 's the reason I do n't like to get in trouble , because she needs me .
It do n't make sense . "

Dobbs said he rushed his daughter to the hospital .
He believes the window actually slowed the bullet down and possibly saved Vynnitra 's life .

“ Why not me ?
She didn’t deserve that , ”
Dobbs said .
" Man just turn yourself in , sir .
Just turn yourself in . "
