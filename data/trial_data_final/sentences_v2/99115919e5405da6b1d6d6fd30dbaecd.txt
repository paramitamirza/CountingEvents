He carries a valid concealed permit , according to deputies .

Fortunately , nobody was in the bathroom when his gun discharged .

Some patrons at the movie theater said they aren’t concerned with guns inside theaters .

“
I just came in , enjoyed the movie , and I did enjoy the movie , ” said Mike Nicolazzo .

“ I do pay attention for the exits , but not for anything other than someone maybe yelling fire , or a fight or something like that , ” said Darrell Harris .

Retired police detective Steven Gardner is concerned about violence in public places like movie theaters .

“ I do find myself looking around , where ’s the exit , who ’s sitting next to me ? ” he said .

“
You should be able to go to the movies , or go to the mall , or do anything in this society without fear of being shot . ”
