Elmhurst police have charged an 18-year - old man from Chicago with weapon offenses following an accidental shooting that happened inside a car parked in the 200 block of Clinton Avenue at 10 p.m. Sunday night .

Mickiel J. Smith , of the 1300 block of North Mayfield Avenue , was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and possession of a firearm without a firearm owner 's identification card .

" The weapon discharged and shot him in the thigh , " Ruth said .
