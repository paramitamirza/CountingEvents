 GRANT COUNTY , Ky ( LEX 18 )
KSP says that a teen in Grant County died after accidentally shooting himself .

KSP responded to the call on Kelly Drive in Crittenden about an accidental shooting around 2:20 a.m. Monday morning .

Detectives say that the initial investigation shows that 17-year - old Roy Hamon was manipulating a handgun when he accidentally shot himself in the head .

KSP says that at this time , no foul play is suspected .

"
He liked to act like he was big and bad , but inside he was much gentler than he 'd let people believe , " said Hamon 's aunt , Regina McDaniel .

The Grant County High School senior was hanging out with his two older sisters and a couple of friends when they say he pulled out a gun .

Hamon said it was unloaded , but then the gun went off .

" It 's not a story in a book .
It 's not a movie .
It 's not a character .
It 's real life , it 's their brother , and they never get to see him again , " said McDaniel .

Word spread across social media on Monday morning , so grief counselors were called to the school to console Hamon 's friends and classmates .

His aunt hopes people learn from this .
It 's a sobering reminder that a gun is not a toy , but a weapon that can kill , and affect the lives left behind .

" It 's not a game , it 's not funny .
It 's not a good Snapchat .
There 's nothing funny about it , " said McDaniel .

There 's a GoFundMe page to help with funeral expenses .
