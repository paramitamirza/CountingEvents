 A man working with a contracted road cleanup crew along 1 - 10 was hospitalized Thursday afternoon after a gun he found in a ditch discharged .

How the gun went off is still being investigated , said Leon County Sheriff â€™s Office Spokesman Lt .
Grady Jordan .
The man is in stable condition .
How the gun ended up in a ditch on the shoulder of the east - west highway is also being investigated .

Even as LCSO investigators lined the westbound highway around midday , officials were trying to determine what led to the shooting .

Jordan said the crew , contracted to pick up trash for the Florida Department of Transportation , found the gun .
The crew 's conversion van was roped off inside the crime scene tape erected by investigators .

LCSO detectives photographed the scene and marked evidence in the ankle - high grass while the crew of about a half - dozen sat waiting .
