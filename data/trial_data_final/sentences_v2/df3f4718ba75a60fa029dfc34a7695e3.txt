 Home video from the Irlbeck family shows the moment when a special pair of glasses changed his worldview forever .

It was instant , ” Cayson said .
“ I knew right away something had changed ( and ) how bright everything was .
”

Cayson Irlbeck ’s new EnChroma glasses use an optical filter that removes certain wavelengths of light and allows colorblind people to better perceive color .

“ That was so amazing , ” Cayson said .
It was so colorful .
It was weird ( because ) I had never seen those colors before , but I kind of knew what they were .
I do n't know .
It was just awesome .
”
 “
Just to be able to see all of a sudden a whole new world opened up for him , obviously it was very emotional , ” said Aaron Irlbeck , Cayson ’s father .

The Irlbeck family discovered the glasses after Cayson researched them on the internet .
Research indicated the glasses had a 50/50 chance of working , but the Irlbecks said the $ 300 glasses were worth the investment .

That day changed my life , ” Cayson said .
