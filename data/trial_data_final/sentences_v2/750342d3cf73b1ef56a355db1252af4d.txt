Stray bullet hits Texas legislator in the head
( CNN ) - A Texas lawmaker is lucky to be alive after an apparent stray bullet hit his head during a New Year 's celebration early Sunday , authorities said .

State Rep. Armando " Mando " Martinez , D - Weslaco , said his wife had just given him a kiss shortly after ringing in the new year with family and friends , and the next thing he knew , " it felt like a sledgehammer hit me over the head . "

A bullet fragment had just punctured the top of the South Texas legislator 's head .

Martinez said he had just stepped outside a home in a rural neighborhood north of Weslaco when he was hit .

Martinez , 40 , was transferred to the neurosurgical unit at Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen , where surgeons removed the bullet fragment .
The fragment had penetrated his skull and lodged itself into the dura mater , the top layer of the brain , doctors told Martinez .

The fragment appears to be from a .223 caliber round , said Martinez , who spoke to CNN by phone on Sunday while recovering at the hospital .

" Had it gone any further , I do n't think we would be having this conversation , " Martinez said .

Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said Martinez 's survival was nothing short of a miracle .

The sheriff 's office is investigating the shooting , and investigators " have reason to believe that ( Martinez ) was hit by a stray bullet , " county sheriff 's office spokesman JP Rodriguez said .

" There is no evidence to indicate he was targeted , " Rodriguez said .

" It was a miracle last night .
I was given another chance at life and I 'm grateful for it , " Martinez said .

Martinez was elected to a seventh term in November and scheduled to take the oath of office January 10 .
