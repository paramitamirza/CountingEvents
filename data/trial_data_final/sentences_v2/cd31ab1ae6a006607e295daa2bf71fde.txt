 A 13-year - old boy was accidentally shot and killed by a 12-year - old relative in Perry County on Sunday afternoon .

According to the Perry County Sheriff ’s Department , the two children were in a bedroom playing with a handgun taken from a family member ’s backpack when Kaden Hammond was shot .

Kaden was taken to Perry County Hospital where he died from his injuries .

The incident occurred Kaden ’s aunt and uncle ’s house on Culps Bend Road in the White Oak Community in Perry County .

“ At some point they entered the parents’ bedroom and discovered the handgun , the loaded 9mm Glock , ” said Perry County Sheriff Nick Weems .

Weems said securing or locking up guns is something he stresses to everyone .

“ I think that everyone should really educate your children .
I know that I educate mine that you don’t touch firearms .
But you never know what a child is going to do when you’re not looking , ” the sheriff said .

According to Safe Tennessee Project , there have been four incidents where a child got a hold of a gun and shot someone so far this year .
Last year , it happened a total of 22 times .

Weems said he feels more needs to be done .

“
Something needs to be in place to have some type of responsibility , but I just don’t know the answer to it , ” he said .

No charges have been filed so far .

A GoFundMe page has been set up to help Kaden ’s family with funeral expenses .
