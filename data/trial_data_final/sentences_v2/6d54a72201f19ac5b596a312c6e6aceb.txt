14-year - old shot in stomach with stolen gun in Masury
MASURY , Ohio ( WKBN ) –
A 14-year - old boy was shot in the stomach in Masury Thursday afternoon .
The man who did it said it was an accident , but the boy ’s family thinks otherwise .

Brookfield Township Police Chief Dan Faustino said two other people were with the boy at the time of the shooting , which happened just before 4 p.m. Thursday at an apartment in the 500 block of Nellie Street .

One of those people was 25-year - old Samual Sanford , who police said admitted to pointing the gun and pulling the trigger , not thinking it was loaded .

“
As a responsible gun owner , you never point a gun at someone , as you always assume that gun is loaded and may go off if you point it at someone and pull a trigger , ”
Faustino said .

A check on the gun revealed it was stolen over 20 years ago in Sharon .
Police are trying to determine how he got a stolen gun .

Sanford was charged with felonious assault for the shooting and receiving stolen property for the gun .

Police said there are still a lot of unanswered questions , such as what the three of them were doing in the building on Nellie Street .

The boy ’s mother said her son was visiting a friend who lives in the building and Sanford asked the two of them to help work on an apartment he was fixing up .

Why Sanford took the gun out is still unknown and police said their work is just beginning .

“
There ’s a lot left to do , ” Faustino said .

He confirmed the boy underwent surgery at St. Elizabeth Health Center in Youngstown Thursday night .

The boy ’s mother said he got out of surgery Friday morning and is in stable condition .
He will need another surgery due to his injuries .

This story is corrected to show the identity of the man arrested .
The man previously named was not charged or arrested .
