IMPD responded to reports of a person shot early Sunday morning .

Around 1:30 a.m. , officers arrived near the 300 block of North Jefferson Ave . to a duplex with a window shot out .

Two teenage male victims , 16 and 17 years old , had been shot and were taken to Eskenazi Hospital for treatment .
One of the teenagers had been shot in the left leg and likely broke his femur , the other was shot in the buttocks .

Officers say the teens were both alert and breathing when they arrived , and their injuries are not considered to be life - threatening .
A police report released several hours after the shooting indicates there were four witnesses , including three 18-year - old men and one 37-year - old woman .

Responding officers tell FOX59 they are also searching for a man who sped off from the scene when police arrived early Sunday morning .
The car traveled only a few blocks when the male driver bailed out of the car and ran off .

" There was a female left inside , " IMPD Captain Michael Elder said .
" We 're looking for the male driver .
We do n't think he 's a hazard to anybody else in the community ... we just want to see why they left the scene in such a big hurry . "

Elder said they did n't know if the car was involved in any way with the shooting , or if the driver and passenger were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time .

For a short period of time , K-9 units and other officers searched a four block area between Beville Ave .
, New York St. and Hamilton Ave . , which is south of the shooting scene .

The investigation is ongoing .
