 Arthur Adams , 19 , was shot and killed during the incident .
Authorities said Adams was one of three people who entered a Walmart neighborhood market and took two grocery carts full of diapers without paying .

As an employee confronted the three alleged thieves in the parking lot , a customer saw the incident and went to help the employee .
When one of the alleged thieves reportedly made a move like he was reaching for something , the customer pulled his gun and fired several shots at the suspected diaper thief .

The three alleged shoplifters tried to flee in a maroon Nissan Rogue , but crashed into two vehicles in the parking lot .
They ran from the scene .
Adams went to a gas station across the street , and keeled over .
He was taken to a hospital , and died some time Saturday .

Hours after the shooting , a female juvenile went to an unspecified hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to the leg .
Detectives were able to identify her as one of three people involved in the incident .

Initially , the sheriff 's office was not certain whether there were three or four suspected shoplifters .
At this time the third person has not been identified .
The OCSO released surveillance photos of a person they hope to identify Sunday evening .
