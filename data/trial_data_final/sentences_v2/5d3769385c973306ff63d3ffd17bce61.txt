The officers said someone in the home began shooting and they returned fire , killing Thompkins .

The officers — police have declined to identify them — had been on administrative leave since the Jan. 22 incident .

All evidence will be turned over to the Allegheny County District Attorney 's Office , which makes the final decision on criminal charges , officials said .

The officers arrived at Thompkins ' home shortly before 4 a.m. after receiving a report of a break - in .
