MT. WASHINGTON ( KDKA ) —
Yasha Ross had her whole life ahead of her .

Her babysitter called the 3-year - old lovable and passionate .

That all ended Sunday afternoon when she got her hands on a gun inside a house in Mt. Washington .

“
It appears that she got possession of a weapon that was in the house and shot herself in the upper chest , ” Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala said .

Zappala indicated that the gun involved was in the possession of a man named Paul Parrish .
It was his home where the child was killed .

The toddler and her mother , who live in Moon Township , had been visiting Parrish .

 “
Parrish has a history of violence , he is a felon not to possess a handgun .
That was his handgun .
A warrant was issued for him yesterday and we are looking for him right now , ”
Zappala said .

U.S. Marshals are assisting Pittsburgh Police in finding Parrish and the federal government may file charges as well .
 “
As a felon not to possess and a child loses her life because he does indeed possess , there is principal here that would make it appropriate to prosecute him for the homicide .
It would be a degree of manslaughter , ” Zappala said .

One other person could be charged in this case .

According to Zappala , a woman purchased that gun for Parrish .
That is being investigated as a “ straw purchase , ” wherein someone buys a firearm and lies about who ultimately will possess the weapon .
That ’s a federal offense .
