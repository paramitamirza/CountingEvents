The shooting happened during a block party to celebrate the Martin Luther King Jr. , holiday -- a Southpark community tradition."It 's a celebration .
When you go down MLK , it 's a celebration .

" Nobody 's fighting the power .
We 're all celebrating a good day , a good man."Police are talking to several eyewitnesses to gather more details."As officers were in the area , they heard gunfire .
They immediately rushed to the location , " HPD Lt .

Fisher says every year something happens during the celebration , but that 's not stopping people from coming to Houston to celebrate."We're not gonna hide .
We 're not gonna stop celebrating Martin Luther King Day and we 're gonna always be on Martin Luther King , " Fisher added .
" I 've been out here 25 years plus and I will continue to come here."All four shooting victims are expected to survive .
