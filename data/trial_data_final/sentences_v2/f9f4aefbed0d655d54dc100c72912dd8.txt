“
My daughter ’s baby daddy was shot and killed from the stuff that happened at Autumn Woods earlier , ” the woman told a dispatcher .

Authorities have arrested a suspect in McDonald ’s murder case , but whoever fired shots at the house on Dennison Avenue hasn’t been caught .

A woman who lives a few doors down on the same street says she heard the gunshots .

“
I told my son to get down .
Like it sounded like firecrackers .
I didn’t know what was going on but the violence needs to stop .
It ’s getting out of control , ” she said .

When a child gets involved , like I said that ’s horrible .
