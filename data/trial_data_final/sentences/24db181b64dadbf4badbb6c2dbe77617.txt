How did a gun get through a checked bag ? NEWLINE
Transportation Security Administration rules allow travelers to pack unloaded firearms in checked luggage , so long as passengers declare their weapons to the airline while checking in , and they are packed in a locked , hard - sided container . NEWLINE
Piro said Santiago followed TSA procedures by checking the weapon .
The strict protocols involve showing the weapon and its carrying case to an airline ticket agent , who then checks that the gun is unloaded .
Ammunition may also be carried in checked baggage but must be stored separately from the gun , said David Williams , assistant professor of aerospace and occupational safety at Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach , Fla. NEWLINE
If the high - tech baggage screening behind the scenes detects a gun that has n't been declared , " that gun will be set aside .
It will not get on the airplane .
And , a law enforcement officer will find and arrest you , " Williams said . NEWLINE
