Parrish has a history of violence , he is a felon not to possess a handgun .
That was his handgun .
A warrant was issued for him yesterday and we are looking for him right now , ”
Zappala said . NEWLINE
U.S. Marshals are assisting Pittsburgh Police in finding Parrish and the federal government may file charges as well . NEWLINE “
As a felon not to possess and a child loses her life because he does indeed possess , there is principal here that would make it appropriate to prosecute him for the homicide .
It would be a degree of manslaughter , ” Zappala said . NEWLINE
One other person could be charged in this case . NEWLINE
According to Zappala , a woman purchased that gun for Parrish .
That is being investigated as a “ straw purchase , ” wherein someone buys a firearm and lies about who ultimately will possess the weapon .
That ’s a federal offense .
