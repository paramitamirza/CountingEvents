As another violent year ends , memories of homicide victims live on NEWLINE Milwaukee has struggled recently with elevated homicide rates , seeing a sharp uptick in 2015 with 146 homicides , and the trend continued last year with 141 homicides recorded .
A recent Wall Street Journal report noted homicide rates in Milwaukee , Chicago , Baltimore and Memphis have returned to levels last seen in the 1990s and quoted an expert who said drug markets likely are playing a role in those cities . NEWLINE
Milwaukee 's per capita homicide rate for 2015 was 24.18 per 100,000 residents — a lower rate than the 26.27 per 100,000 residents in 1991 — and dipped slightly last year to 23.5 per 100,000 residents . NEWLINE
Police officials here have cited easy access to firearms and a willingness to use them to settle disputes or arguments as one key factor in the climbing homicide rates .
Arguments or fights were the motive in 31 % of homicides last year , according to Police Department data .
The second leading motive was domestic violence , which accounted for 11 % of homicides . NEWLINE
Experts have long said homicides and other violent crimes are often concentrated among tight networks of people and places disproportionately affected by larger , underlying problems such as poverty , segregation and limited opportunity .
Other studies also have suggested deteriorating police - community relations could play a role , as well . NEWLINE
