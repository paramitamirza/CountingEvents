Lt . Sean Edwards say that officers performed CPR but were unable to save the teen . 
Johnson rushed to the scene right when he found out what happened to his nephew .

Johnson gathered the many loved ones on the scene and prayed with them . 
" I was praying for strength , " he told us . 
Edwards says that police interviewed several people who were in the car with the victim to understand what happened . 
Edwards says the victim and those with him were meeting another group in an alley off the intersection to purchase a handgun and exchange handguns . Edwards says someone in a brown - colored vehicle started firing into the alley , striking the victim , who then fled to the street where he collapsed . 
Police say the suspects then fled the scene . There have been no arrests at this time . 
Detectives believe this meetup was set up through Facebook . 
â€œ This is extremely unfortunate . The fact that another young person can invest the energy and effort into activities that are detrimental to their lives . Sad , " Edwards said .

" We trust that justice will prevail . The law will do what the law needs to do here so that we can get to the bottom of what happened here , " he said . 
Johnson is the second Wenonah High School student to be killed within a week . Juzahris Webb , 17 , was shot and killed Jan. 31 while walking home from school .
