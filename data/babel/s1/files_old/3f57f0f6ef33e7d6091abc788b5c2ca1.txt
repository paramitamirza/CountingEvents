UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS - A professor caught in the crossfire and killed during a shooting is being remembered by his family , students and staff at John Carroll University . 
" The probability of this happening is unreal , " said the victim 's nephew Nathan Wilder . " I do n't know what to say . " 
The murder of David Wilder , 61 has left a hole that will be difficult to fill in three college communities : Tri - C , Cleveland State and John Carroll University where he served as an adjunct professor . Several of his art students attended his memorial service . 
" We just saw him and it 's just crazy to think that like one week he 's here and the next week he 's not , " said student Andrew Nahra . 
Investigators say Wilder was shot one week ago while driving down Woodland Avenue near East 89th Street Saturday afternoon . During a recent press conference about violence in Cleveland , the police chief called the shooting a " running gun battle . " Tywan Cortez Johnson , 15 , was also killed in the shooting . 
" We would like justice to be served but at the end of the day it does n't bring him back , " said Nathan . " I 'm not going to allow that tragedy to diminish the life of my uncle . " 
Three men are charged with aggravated murder for Wilder 's death . 
A GoFundMe page has raised more than $ 15,000 dollars toward its $ 7,500 dollar goal for funeral expenses . The page states excess money will be used to create an art scholarship in Wilder 's name .
