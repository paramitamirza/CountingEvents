Texas woman recovering after being shot in the face during struggle with suicidal father 

Brittany Howard and her husband have 2-year - old twin girls and a 4-year - old daughter . Three weeks ago , she came close to never seeing her family again."I was shot in the face and survived . Not many people have gone through that and can live to tell about it , " Howard said . Last month , Howard 's mother called her and said Howard 's father was acting strangely . When she arrived , Howard said , her father had a gun and was threatening to take his own life."We both jerked and somehow it went off , " she said . Howard was shot in the face and has since undergone three surgeries."It went three centimeters into my frontal lobe , so I have a metal plate in my head , " she said . Three weeks later , she is still healing . She has a skin graft on her nose and has at least three more surgeries in her future . Still , despite it all , she has a remarkable outlook on life."I love my dad , and it was an accident , " Howard said . It was an accident that left wounds she said she can heal from , unlike the scars she might have had if she had lost her father."He 's completely different . He 's completely changed and sometimes it takes a tragic accident or a tragic occurrence to change someone 's outlook or perspective on life , " she said . According to Howard , her father has been charged with aggravated assault with a weapon of a family member . She said she was upset with the district attorney 's office for charging him , insisting the shooting was an accident and he was in a bad place at the time . She said that since the shooting occurred , her father has changed his perspective on life and has a new outlook . He told her he would spend the rest of his life making it up to her . Due to the surgeries , Howard has not been able to work . She has started a Go Fund Me page to help pay for medical expenses
