Anthony Bentley thought he 'd come face - to - face with a burglar who shot two police officers , his lawyer said Monday . 
But instead of helping police nab a wanted man , Bentley - a high school student in the Houston Police Department Explorers program - mistakenly shot 17-year - old Derrick Green three times . 
Bentley , also 17 , is now facing an aggravated assault charge . But Green 's family and activist Quanell X held a press conference Monday demanding a stiffer charge for what they see as " vigilante " justice .

" This was an attempted murder ; he attempted to kill this young man , " Quanell said . " We are demanding that District Attorney Kim Ogg upgrade the charges to attempted murder . " 
The chaos unfolded Tuesday afternoon in west Houston , even as a massive police manhunt was underway just 10 miles south . 
Bentley was at home when an officer with the Explorers program sent out an alarming message : Two officers had been shot by a burglar , and now his partner in crime was on the loose . 
The high school student headed out to the bank , hopping in his mother 's car to deposit money . 
" So he drives a block from his house and is almost killed by this guy going 60 or 70 mph and he hears all these sirens , " his lawyer Joe Gutheinz said .

Thinking he 'd seen the wanted shooter speeding by with no police in sight , Bentley decided to follow to relay the suspect 's location to officers . 
But just a few seconds later , the fleeing car crashed into a fire hydrant on Canoga . The driver jumped out and started running . 
Still sitting in his car , Bentley thought the man on the loose was a police shooter . Instead , it was Green , whose family said he 'd done nothing more than steal a car . 
Green never ran toward Bentley , according to Quanell . 
" What justifies this young man shooting this young boy three times in the back ? " Quanell said . 
But Gutheinz said the running teen turned around at one point , possibly looking for a different exit route .

" He 's absolutely convinced this is the guy who shot the cops , " Gutheinz said of his client . " He 's in the wrong place at the wrong time and he 's panicking . " 
So Bentley reached for his mother 's gun , stashed under the seat . He fired off four shots and hit Green three times - in the leg , shoulder and back , according to the district attorney 's office . 
Bentley stayed at the scene and offered a statement to police , his lawyer said . 
Green was taken to the hospital but prosecutors said he had n't formally been charged with car theft as of Monday afternoon . 
" Was he wrong for stealing the car ? Absolutely he was wrong . And he should be punished for that - and he will be , " Quanell said . 
" But we can not have a society where people become vigilantes like this . " 
The district attorney 's office did not rule out the possibility of more serious charges , although attempted murder would fall into the same sentencing range as aggravated assault . 
" We are evaluating all facts and evidence in the case , " spokesman Dane Schiller said in a statement . 
" It has not been presented to the grand jury . At that time , additional charges or a different charge may be considered . " 
Gutheinz hopes that does n't happen . 
" He 's a really good guy , " he said . " He 's not a vigilante or a hero . He 's a 17-year - old kid who tried to do the right thing . " 
But Quanell dismissed the Houston - area lawyer 's defense of his client . 
" I did not know HPD taught cadet explorers how to use firearms and how to assist police officers when necessary with deadly force , " he said . 
" The climate in America has grown to such a dangerous climate that you can shoot a young black male and claim any defense . 
" Obviously , what he is saying could not be further from the truth than the devil is from god . "
