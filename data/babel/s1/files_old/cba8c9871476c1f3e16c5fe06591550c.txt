MEMPHIS , Tenn. -- He was # 10 on the field , but number one in his friends ' hearts . 
Fifteen - year - old Jaheim Walker was killed after police said a gunman opened fire on a car he was in on Cherry Road early Saturday morning . 
" Words ca n't explain how I feel right now to know that he 's no longer here , " Di'Jerika Powell , a classmate , said . 
Friends lost their voices after crying through the day and night . 
Walker was a football player at Overton High School with big dreams . 
" It hurts my heart . It really hurts my heart to know that he 's not going to be here tomorrow , and I ca n't call him toâ€”. I just do n't understand , " Powell explained . 
Friends said Walker , his brother and some friends got into some sort of altercation with another group at the Overton High School basketball game on Friday night . 
" The police told them to get off the school premises with all that , " Powell recalled . 
A short time after the shooting , the victims ' car was found at St. Francis Hospital riddled with bullet holes . 
Doctors pronounced Walker dead , a 16-year - old was flown to the hospital in extremely critical condition , an 18-year - old was hit in his side and the driver was n't injured . 
For many at Overton High , the group of young men is like family , which makes coping with the loss harder to deal with . 
" Y'all see that it 's hurting . Like his mom is torn . He was the baby . His brother . He only had one brother . He was the baby , " Powell said . 
Walker was a teenage boy who had his life snatched away far too soon .
