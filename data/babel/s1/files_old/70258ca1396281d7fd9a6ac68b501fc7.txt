He added that hundreds of people were inside of the nightclub at the time of the shooting , and called it a “ chaotic crime scene . ” “ Many of them fled , unfortunately . Many of the witnesses fled , but everyone that we can identify is being interviewed , ” he said .

Surveillance cameras were inside the club at the time of the shooting , police said , and investigators are viewing the tapes . Neudigate added that Sunday morning ’s shooting was one of the largest shooting cases that he has worked in his 27-plus years with the department . Cameo nightclub has had several issues in the past , authorities said . The club allows admission to anyone over the age of 18 on certain days , and is open until 4 a.m. on Saturdays . “ We are aware of it . It has had some challenges in the past , ” Neudigate said . Police said there were two shootings at the nightclub in 2015 : one on New Year 's Day , when someone was shot in the foot , and another in September , when a shooting victim was found in the parking lot . Isaac said Cameo is a large establishment , and it employs off - duty police officers to patrol the parking lot . Photos : Mass shooting at Cincinnati 's Cameo Night Club 
“ It is my understanding that they do wand individuals and pat them down , ” Isaac said of the club ’s security measures . “ However , what we know at this point , several firearms were able to be brought inside the bar . ” The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms is helping Cincinnati police with the investigation . Cincinnati restaurateur Jeff Ruby is offering a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the shooting death , he tweeted Sunday .
