Police said the victim was an adult , and a woman at the scene who identified herself as the victim 's sister said the victim was 22 years old . 
No arrests have been made , but multiple people have been taken in for questioning . Hamer said the person who shot the victim is a female . They have a gun is their possession , but do n't know who it belongs to or how it was obtained . 
The shooting occurred at a home on the 2300 block of Raceway Road . 
Reports show police had been called to the house multiple times Sunday , at 5:30 p.m. , 6:33 p.m. and 6:43 p.m. , all for disturbances . Police were called to the scene just after 7 p.m. Sunday for the fatal shooting . 
Neighbors witnessed the multiple police calls , and said officers had left the house just 10 minutes before the victim was shot . 
Jack Paff , one of the victim 's neighbors , said he had seen police coming and going from the house all afternoon . 
" I blame IMPD , " Paff said . " It escalated , it kept escalating ... they kept arguing and fighting . " 
He heard a gunshot just before he got into the shower , and rushed outside , joining other neighbors and family watching the investigation . 
" They could have prevented it if they kept the cops here , " Paff said . " A useless death , that 's all it is . "
