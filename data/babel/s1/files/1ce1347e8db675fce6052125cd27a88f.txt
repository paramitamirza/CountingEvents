MEMPHIS , Tenn. -- The grandmother of a 4-year - old who was shot Sunday night in Memphis has been charged . 
Diane Nellums was charged with child abuse and neglect after police say her three - year - old grandson shot his four - year - old brother inside a home on Mirror Avenue in Frayser . 
Memphis Police said they initially showed up to the house just before 8 p.m. Sunday night after a report someone had fired shots at the house . 
“ At the time they were investigating you heard another pop . Like I said , all the other police were there and they ran in the house and found a child had been shot , ” said neighbor Chris Hill . 
Police said the child shot his brother in the arm . The injured victim is expected to be okay . 
Nellums told officers she came out of the house and fired several shots in the ground to scare off whoever was shooting at their house . Initial information said she put the gun in a lock box but did not lock it . 
In an affidavit WREG obtained Monday , police said she left the gun in plain view in the living room . The three - year - old picked it up and dropped it , accidentally shooting his four - year - old brother . 
WREG discovered this was n't the first time Nellums has been in trouble . In 2010 , she was arrested after police said she gave her sons a stick to fight other children instead of breaking it up . 
Now neighbors are thankful her grandson will be okay , but said it ’s a sad reminder you have to be extra cautious . 
“ Outta keep it locked up . You don’t fool with no guns around no children , ” said Arthur Gross .
