Madera County mother charged in deadly accidental shooting of 1-year - old son makes first court appearance 

Less than two months after her one - year - old son was killed by gun fire Erica Bautista of Chowchilla made an appearance in court . Bautista worked as a state corrections officer for 16 years and she now faces felony manslaughter and felony child abuse charges after investigators say her three - year - old daughter accidentally shot her younger brother in the head . The gun , registered to Bautista , was not a duty weapon-- detectives suspect it was not stored properly."Particularly we are charging her of child abuse , not only of the child that died but also child abuse of the three - year - old child who was in the bed with her and the infant when the tragedy occurred , " said David Linn , Madera County District Attorney."Why does the charging authority of this county feel it necessary to make an example of a single working Latina mother who 's going to be mourning for the rest of her life , " said Jeffrey Krasnoff , defense attorney . Despite the complex nature of the case Linn said this is a serious offense."As a father , and as a grandfather , it 's gotta be tragic for her-- but the law is the law."The judge continued the case to March 21st and allowed Bautista to go free , without bail , pending trial . She 's also not allowed to have firearms in possession . If convicted on all four counts Bautista could face more than 10 years in prison .
