Riverview man arrested for shooting a woman in the back , lied to deputies about owning a gun 

Hillsborough County Deputies arrested a Riverview man they say shot a woman in the back inside of his home early Sunday morning . 
According to a search warrant of the home in the Towne Estates subdivision , 41-year - old Edward Castro initially told 911 dispatchers he was outside of his home when an " unknown suspect " shot the woman in his 2nd story bathroom . 
Castro appeared to leave the woman while being directed to render aid until emergency crews arrived , according to the warrant . Castro also told deputies he did not own a gun . 
According to neighbors , deputies spent about 12 hours searching the home and surrounding areas , including a pond and a neighbor 's vehicles , for the weapon used in the crime . Deputies finally found two guns hidden in a bush two houses down . 
Deputies say Castro eventually admitted to the shooting , but says it was accidental . 
Arrest documents show Castro is on felony probation . He claimed he denied the shooting and hid his guns because he was afraid he would get into trouble . 
We are not identifying the woman or her relationship to Castro because she is the victim of a crime .
