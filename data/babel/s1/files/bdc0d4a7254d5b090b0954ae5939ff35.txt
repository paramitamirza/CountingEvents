OSCEOLA , Ark. -- The family of a teenager shot by police is telling us their side of the story . 
They say 16-year - old Zyrion Matlock was shot in the lower back Friday morning by an Osceola Police officer . 
The Arkansas State Police department is investigating the case . They said Osceola officers were responding to a call about a robbery at the Shell station off I- 55 in Osceola Arkansas . 
Paris Matlock , Zyrion ’s older sister claims he didn’t rob anyone at the Shell Station . 
The family says When officers showed up at 1:40 Friday morning he ran because a weapon was pointed at him . 
“ Cause it ’s a gun , you see it on the news all the time a white officer with a black young guy and a gun and them don’t usually end well , ” exclaimed Paris Matlock . 
Osceola Police said they showed up to the gas station after receiving a robbery call . They took one teen into custody . When they tried to take Matlock into custody , they say he tried to run to a vehicle that wasn’t his and when they attempted to remove him , something went wrong and an officer shot Matlock . 
For sister , Paris , the only thing her younger brother is guilty of is staying out past his curfew . 
Matlock ’s father , Nathan Matlock , said Zyrion was at the gas station to get a drink . He knows his son wasn’t supposed to be out , in fact even his intuition told him something was off . 
“ I called him on my lunch break and asked where he ’s at he said he was at home . I told him stay there . He asked why . I told him I just got a bad feeling about tonight . Don’t go out . He went out . You see what happens , ” he said . 
Nathan said his son was not armed . 
“ He doesn’t even own a gun , ” he explained . 
Zyrion ’s cousin , Courtney Talley , described him as an outgoing guy that everyone knows . 
“ He ’s one of those people , he’ll make ya laugh . He ’s one of those people who will keep you laughing like to joke around and play a lot , ” said Talley . 
The family does acknowledge the Osceola High junior , who plays running back for the football team , has had a few problems in the past but nothing this serious . 
His father hopes his son learned a lesson . 
“ I think he’ll be a more obedient person , ” he said . 
While his sister wants the officer who fired the shot to be held accountable . 
”Why did this happen ? Why did you do this ? We’re not supposed to be scared of the police . You’re supposed to serve and protect and we’re scared of you , ” she questioned . 
WREG reached out to the Osceola Police Department multiple times but have not heard back .
