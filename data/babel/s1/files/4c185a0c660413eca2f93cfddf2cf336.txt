CLARISSA — A Clarissa man has been charged in the death of a woman who was shot and killed early Saturday morning . Todd County authorities have charged 32-year - old Tyler Slagerman with one count of second degree unintentional manslaughter and one count of child endangerment . 
According to the criminal complaint , Slagerman called 911 just before 2:00 a.m. Saturday to report 36-year - old Lacey Kuschel had been accidentally shot when a gun had fallen off the counter and discharged , hitting her in the upper part of her back . 
When a sheriff ’s deputy arrived on scene , he noticed a lever - action rifle on the ground in the living room . When the deputy entered the bedroom he noticed an infant in the crib and a distraught Slagerman doing chest compressions on the woman who was lying on the bed . 
Records show Slagerman told the officer he had been out with friends earlier and had four drinks before returning home at approximately 12:45 a.m. 
Slagerman said he later grabbed the rifle to go and check out why the dogs were barking , assuming there was a coyote in the yard . Kuschel was holding the baby because it had woke up crying due to the barking dogs . 
Slagerman said when he grabbed the rifle from the corner , he turned around fast and headed toward the door . That ’s when he said the gun went off and hit Kuschel . The baby was not hurt in the incident . 
Court records show four hours later , Slagerman ’s blood - alcohol level was .073 which is just below the legal limit to drive . 
Slagerman is being held in the Todd County Jail on $ 100,000 unconditional bail .
