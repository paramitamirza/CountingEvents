She says she grew up in the area , and adds this is the direct result of her old home being neglected."These children have absolutely nothing to do in the community . If you look around , there 's no community center for them . These children need vocational training . They need an outlet , " said Moore . We spoke with Ann Strickland Sunday night , who is also calling for change."It bothers me as a great - grandmother to know that the children do n't have any recreation , so what are they going to do ? " said Strickland . " They get into trouble."Neighbors say this is a part of the city that has been severely neglected . They simply want more opportunities for the kids who are growing up here."It 's a forgotten neighborhood . This was a very viable neighborhood . I was raised in this neighborhood , " Moore said."Now what I see around here is the children do n't have anything to do , and this is very sad , " said Strickland . At this point , no word from police on a suspect or what led to the shooting.------
