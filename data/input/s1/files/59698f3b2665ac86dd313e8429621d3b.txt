" We were enjoying Sunday dinner at my mother â€™s house , when I had to slam and lock the door , tell everybody to drop , " said Queen Sheena , who lives nearby . " I thought we were being bombed . " 
Police say gunshots were fired from several cars traveling on Church Street on Sunday evening . Police say Hicks was driving a vehicle , and was hit with at least one bullet .
