HOUSTON( AP ) - Police have arrested a 19-year - old man for the fatal shooting of an 8-year - old Houston girl following a traffic accident last weekend . 
Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said Wednesday that police are withholding the name of the man in custody because charges are pending . 
The girl 's mother , Latoyia Thomas , told authorities she and her daughter , DeMaree Atkins , were on their way home around 2 a.m. Saturday when their car collided with another car that was speeding with a third car . Someone in one of the speeding vehicles began shooting and DeMaree was killed . 
Acevedo says the child and her mother were innocent victims . He says he and Mayor Sylvester Turner believed it was important to announce an arrest because " when someone kills an 8-year - old little girl everyone needs to worry . "
