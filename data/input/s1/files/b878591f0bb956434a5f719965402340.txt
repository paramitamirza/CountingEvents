Copscuff man who shot himself in Bronx , blamed it on black man 

Heaccidentally shot himself in the stomach at a Bronx park â€” and shot himself in the foot when he blamed the blunder on a phantom black man . 
Cops arrested 20-year - old Arthur Palombo on Thursday , after seeing through his lies and determining the gunshot he suffered near the tennis courts inside Williamsbridge Oval Park off of W. 208th St. and Bainbridge Ave . in Norwood Wednesday was self - inflicted . 
Palombo accidentally shot himself in the left side of the stomach about 10:45 p.m. , police said . The bullet exited his left flank . 
First responders took him to Jacobi Medical Center . 
He told investigators he went to the park to show an old revolver he had in his apartment to a potential buyer he had met a few weeks earlier . 
The buyer , however , shot down the $ 100 asking price and shot him with the piece as they haggled over the price , he claimed . 
When pressed , Palombo , who is Hispanic , described the shooter as a black man with a bald head . 
Cops searched the park and found the revolver . 
When Palombo was released from the hospital , he was questioned by detectives again , this time admitting he was by himself and the gun went off accidentally in his jacket pocket . 
Prosecutors charged him with weapons possession and filing a false report . 
A judge ordered him held on $ 10,000 bail during his arraignment Friday , officials said .
