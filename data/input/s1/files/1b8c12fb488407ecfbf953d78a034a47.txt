Stokes , 28 , and Edwin Davis , 32 , were fatally shot inside the restaurant . Two other men , 19-year - old Raheem Jackson and his 20-year - old brother Dillon Jackson , ran from the restaurant as gunfire erupted , but both were fatally shot in different parking lots within a block of the restaurant , authorities said . All four were pronounced dead at the scene , according to the Cook County medical examiner 's office . Stokes and the Jacksons lived in South Shore ; Davis was a Brainerd neighborhood resident . Dillon and Raheem Jackson had gone to the restaurant to visit their mother , who has worked there for eight years , according to their grandmother , Georgia Jackson .
