Auroraman expected to survive accidental shooting 

A21-year - old Aurora man was seriously injured in what police said appears to be an accidental shooting last week . 
At about 11 p.m. Jan. 3 , the man and two friends , a 21-year - old Aurora man and an 18-year - old Oswego woman , were apparently passing around a shotgun inside a home on the 900 block of Almond Drive when it went off , injuring the man in the abdomen , police spokesman Dan Ferrelli said in an email . 
The man 's friends , joined by a 20-year - old Aurora man , took him to an Aurora hospital where he received treatment , Ferrelli said . 
No one else was injured , Ferrelli said . Alcohol apparently was a factor in the incident , for which there have been no charges , Ferrelli said . 
The man injured is expected to survive , Ferrelli said .
