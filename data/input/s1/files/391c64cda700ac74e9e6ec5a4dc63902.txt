Ateen charged in a deadly shooting in Sumter County while he was out on bond for a separate attempted murder case will remain in jail . 
A Sumter County magistrate did not set bond for Rhythm Sharmell Portee , 17 , at his hearing . Portee is charged with manslaughter in the shooting death of 19-year - old Kyre Raquan Bethea Thursday night . 
Investigators say Bethea was shot in the chest as he and Portee played a game with a gun . 
Because of the nature of the charge , Portee will be held in the Sumter - Lee Regional Detention Center until he can appear before a circuit court judge , which the Sumter County Sheriff 's Office says will be in March . 
At the time of the shooting , Portee had been out on bond for an attempted murder charge stemming from an incident in December . He is facing charges in adult court in both cases .
