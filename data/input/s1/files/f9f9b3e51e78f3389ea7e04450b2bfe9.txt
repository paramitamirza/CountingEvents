" The police woke me up at 11 o'clock and asked me if I had heard any gunshots and I said ' No I had not . ' Supposedly there was a child shot here and of course the officer told me this morning that he was in critical condition , " said neighbor Sarah Simmons . 
The aunt drove to the 7-Eleven on Eastway Drive , less than a mile away , to call for help , detectives said .
