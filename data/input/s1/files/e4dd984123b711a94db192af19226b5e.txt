Trialpushed back to September in Howland murder case 
WARREN , Ohio ( WYTV ) – The man charged with capital murder stemming from the shooting in Howland that killed two people and wounded three others was back in a Trumbull County Courtroom Thursday . 
Nasser Hamad appeared for another pre - trial , but this time signed a waiver , pushing his trial date back another 180 days . 
His new trial date is set for September 18 . 
Hamad is facing two counts of capital murder and six counts of attempted murder stemming from the shooting at his property off Route 46 in Howland last month . 
Joshua Williams , 20 , and Josh Harber , 19 , were killed . Three others were injured . Hamad ’s family says he was acting in self - defense . 
Before Hamad ’s hearing , his family , friends , and other supporters were holding “ Justice for Nasser ” signs outside the courthouse . 
“ We are here to support Nasser . We are trying to see justice for Nasser . We want to make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else , ” said Mike Hamad , Nasser Hamad ’s brother . 
Prosecutors have said Hamad challenged the group to a fight before the shooting , asking them to come to his house . After the initial confrontation ended , prosecutors say Hamad went back into his house , got his gun and came back outside shooting at their vehicle .
