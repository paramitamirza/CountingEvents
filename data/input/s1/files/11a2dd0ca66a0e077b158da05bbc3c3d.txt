LOUISVILLE , Ky. ( WDRB ) -- Thursday afternoon was a chaotic one in west Louisville , but it started in the most simple of ways with a fender bender at a liquor store near 39th and Market Streets . 
" As I was backing out , a car was pulling in , and we collided , " said 18 year - old Maranda Dillon . " We just sit there for about two minutes , and then nothing happened . He did n't get out of the car , and I did n't get out of the car . I just pulled out like everything was OK. " 
Moments later , gun shots ring out and Dillon panicked . Her 4 month - old baby boy was sitting in the backseat . 
" I was screaming , ' My baby . My baby , " she told WDRB. 
A friend of a friend was also in the back and dove over the baby to protect him . Dillon hit the gas . She was frantic to to find safety . 
" I was running through stop signs and everything , " Dillon said . " I was scared out of my mind . " 
She pulled into the Dairy Mart at 28th and Market Streets , called the police and realized her baby was fine . 
But not everyone came out unscathed . That friend of a friend , a teenage boy , was grazed by one of the bullets . He is expected to be fine . 
" I feel like it 's my fault , all because of a car , " Dillon said . " The dude wanted to shoot somebody over a car . " 
The suspect is still on the run , even after a two - hour search to find him Thursday afternoon . 
The damage to Dillon 's black Ford is nothing when she thinks about the what - ifs . 
" If it was n't for him doing that , it probably would 've been my baby , " Dillon said . 
Security was heightened at the Academy @ Shawnee shortly after the shooting as a precaution .
