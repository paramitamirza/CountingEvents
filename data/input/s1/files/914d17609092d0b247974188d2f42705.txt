Bendman accidentally shot by lifelong friend , deputies say 

BEND, Ore. - A 22-year - old Bend man was accidentally shot in the chest Saturday night by his 21-year - old lifelong friend , who was unloading a handgun at a home east of the city , Deschutes County sheriff ’s deputies said . 
Trevor Rogers was flown by Life Flight helicopter to St. Charles Bend , where he was listed in fair condition late Saturday night , according to a house supervisor . 
Sgt . Mike Sundberg said no criminal charges were filed against the man who fired the gun , Julian Messner , but the incident will be forwarded to the district attorney ’s office for review . 
Deputies were called to Messner 's home , in the area of Skywagon Drive near Cougar Trail , on the report of an accidental shooting . 
The shooting occurred when Messner tried to unload a 9 mm semi - automatic handgun , Sundberg said . 
Messner released the handgun ’s magazine and thought he cycled the action on the gun to remove the bullet from the chamber , according to the sergeant . But the bullet did not clear the gun ’s chamber , and Messner ’s finger depressed the trigger , causing it to fire and hit Rogers in the upper torso . 
Messner immediately called 911 and rendered aid , Sundberg said . Bend Fire medics treated Rogers on scene and he later was able to provide a statement that supported it being an accidental shooting . 
" He 's very lucky , " Sundberg said , adding that neither man was impaired by alcohol or drugs . 
The sergeant said the sheriff 's office would like to remind everyone to follow the 12 Golden Rules for safe gun handling : 
1 . Always treat the gun as if it 's loaded 
2 . Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction 
3 . Always keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to shoot
