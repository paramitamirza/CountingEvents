" Evidently the young man made an idle threat , " Angela Jones , the victim 's cousin , said . " Kevin feared for his life . " 
They are still unsure how Branch obtained a gun . 
" He went to put the gun into his waistband and we suspect that 's when it went off , " Chief Todd Grooms of the Crittenden County Sheriff 's Department , said . 
Officials said evidence and witnesses , showed the teen had accidentally shot himself in the abdomen . 
" We do n't suspect foul play in any way , " Grooms explained . 
The family says Branch was a junior in high school , and an honors student . 
" Now he wo n't be able to enjoy the pleasure of most young men as far as walking across the stage and an honor graduate because his life ended last night , " Jones said . 
Branch is remembered as a young man who was happy , loved fashion , and worked hard .
