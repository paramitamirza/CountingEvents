One man is in custody but no charges have been filed in a shooting outside a rural Missouri nightclub that left one man dead and six others injured , authorities said Monday . 
Gunfire broke out at 3:50 a.m. Sunday in the parking lot of Club Envy in Caruthersville , a small town in the far southeastern corner of Missouri , about 90 miles north of Memphis , Tennessee . 
Authorities believe the shooter was acquainted with the victims , but even those who were shot have been reluctant to provide details , said Sgt . Clark Parrott of the Missouri State Highway Patrol . 
" We 're trying to piece everything together but apparently as they were trying to get people out of the club , someone in the parking lot fired a weapon , " Parrott said . 
Police initially said two people were taken into custody , but Parrott later said that one of the men was arrested for an outstanding criminal warrant unrelated to the shooting . 
The club had been rented out for a private party with about 300 guests , Parrott said . Many of the guests were still present when the shooting occurred . He said no charges have been filed against the two people in custody . 
Six men were shot . One died at a hospital in nearby Hayti , Missouri , about seven hours after the shooting . Two people were flown to a hospital in Memphis , Tennessee , in critical condition . Three others are in stable condition at the Hayti hospital . 
Another man suffered cuts and bruises when he either ran through a window or was thrown through it , Parrott said . 
Names of the victims , and the man in custody , have not been released .
