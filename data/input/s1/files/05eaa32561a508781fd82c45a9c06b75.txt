As of late Wednesday afternoon , 14 officers responded to the scene along with 10 investigators from the District Attorney 's office , and on Thursday the investigation continued . 
“ They are going through painstaking process of reviewing the evidence , including the body cams , " Ed Hazel , managing deputy district attorney said on Thursday . 
Salinas police declined to comment beyond announcing the incident . They said the Monterey County District Attorney 's Office will conduct the investigation . 
Hazel said witnesses reported they saw a juvenile Hispanic male wielding a knife . Officers tried to disarm the juvenile and chased him into a residence . It was at that time that the suspect allegedly turned and charged the officers , forcing them to defend themselves by opening fire on him with their service weapons . Hazel said fire hoses , rubber bullets and tasers were used " various times during the contact before the deploying of lethal weapon . ” 
The juvenile died at the scene . 
Authorities said they would have no additional information coming and were not planning to hold a press conference on the shooting at this time .
