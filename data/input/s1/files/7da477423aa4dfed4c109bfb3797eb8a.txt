“ I heard about maybe 10 rounds , ‘ Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! Boom!,’ so I came to my door and looked out I didn’t see anything , ” neighbor Alexander Gray said . “ Later on I found out they were at the center shooting . Gray said in recent years the area that used to have a higher instance of violent crime had changed for the better . There were fewer shootings and more people enjoying the park , playground and community activities at the McFerrin Community Center . 
“ It is normally not like this , ” he said . “ People jog and walk their dogs . He continued , “ When it gets bad and they get to shooting , we really need to do something . Kit Grissom runs a group home in the area and uses the gym at the community center . 
“ I go over there and work out , ” he said . “ The guys in the home go over there just about every day to work out . ” 
He added , “ One of them was in the gym yesterday when it happened . He had to hit the floor . ” 
Metro police told News 2 the shooting does not appear to be gang related , but it is clear the two groups of people have some sort of bad blood . 
“ We know someone in the area knows what happened and we need them to call us anonymously , ” MNPD Spokeswoman Kristin Mumford said . “ It is very fortunate that no one was killed . You have guys unloading out of a car and firing . ”
