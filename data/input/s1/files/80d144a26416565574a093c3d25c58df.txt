The Rankin County Sheriff called the shooting of a 14-month - old baby by his 4-year - old brother a tragic accident . Advertisement The incident was reported Tuesday night on Shadowridge Drive in Barnett Bend subdivision , authorities said . The 4-year - old took a .45-caliber handgun from an unlocked gun safe , Sheriff Bryan Bailey said . The gun accidentally discharged , and a bullet struck the baby in the shoulder area , Bailey said . The parents were at home at the time , but the boys were alone in the room , Bailey said . A neighbor , who is a nurse , helped secure the boy 's wound until paramedics arrived . The father of the boys told investigators that he had closed the Liberty gun safe but did n't spin the tumbler to lock it . “ We all know children and know they can get into anything , ” Bailey said . “ Especially with young children in the home , you have to secure those weapons and secure them properly . ” The 14-month - old was taken to the University of Mississippi Medical Center , where Bailey said he is in stable condition . 
Bailey said that it 's a miracle that the child survived . No charges are expected to be filed , Bailey said . " The home was well - kept . The children were well - kept , and it was just a tragic accident , " Bailey said . " I am not going to punish the parents . I think they have paid the price themselves for this . "
