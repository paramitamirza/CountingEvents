SHREVEPORT - A Shreveport Police Corporal is on leave after police say her gun was used by a toddler to injure another child . 
Shortly before 8:00 p.m. on February 7 , 2017 , Shreveport Police patrol officers responded to a home in the 5500 block of Trevor Drive relative to reports of a shooting . 
Upon arrival , officers discovered a juvenile victim had been transported via private auto to Willis - Knighton Medical Center in the 2500 block of West Bert Kouns Industrial Loop after receiving a gunshot wound to the left leg . 
The child was subsequently transported to University Health by the Shreveport Fire Department with what was described as a non - life - threatening wound . 
Based on information and evidence gathered at the scene , detective supervisors believe a toddler living in the home of off - duty Shreveport Police Corporal Latoyia Marsden gained access to her concealed department - issued service weapon and accidentally discharged the handgun , striking the other child in the leg . 
The investigation is ongoing at this hour .
