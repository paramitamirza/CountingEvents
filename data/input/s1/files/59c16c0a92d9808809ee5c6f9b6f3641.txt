Boy, 9 , shot on Detroit 's west side 

DETROIT- A 9-year - old boy was shot in the head Saturday on Detroit 's west side , police said . 
Malik Cosey was sitting in his grandmother â€™s car at a home in the 15000 block of Murray Hill Street , near Keller Street , when he was shot . 
" He 's an innocent kid . Just speak up , " Tiana Holcomb , the victim 's aunt , said , urging the shooter to come forward . " What if it was your kid ? " 
Cosey and two other children , ages 7 and 11 , were waiting to go to the movies . Police said his grandmother was in the house when the gunfire occurred . 
Police said several shots were fired toward the car before the shooter sped off . 
" Like nine shots , and we were in the house with all the windows closed and we could hear it , " neighbor Charlene Hawkins said . 
At least one bullet pierced Malik in the head . The other children were not physically hurt . 
" I 've been praying for him every since I found out , " Holcomb said . " He 's just a joyful kid . He was just ready to go to the movies . That 's all he wanted to do . " 
Police do n't believe the car full of children only was the intended target . 
" It was purposely meant for somebody , but a mistake . It happened to an innocent child , " said Alonte Sims , the victim 's uncle . 
The boy was taken to a hospital by his father , police said . His condition was unknown . 
Police are searching for a silver or gray Dodge Magnum with tinted windows . A witness followed the car from the scene , and it was last seen near McNichols Road and Outer Drive . 
As they search for clues in the neighborhood , investigators hope those with the guns think before pulling the trigger . 
" Certainly all these shootings should stop . There 's a better way to solve disputes than use a gun , " Deputy Chief David LeValley said .
