Paramedics rushed him to the hospital and he 's currently still in critical condition . 
Witnesses said the victim was inside the store waiting in line when Little walked in , pulled a gun , and shot the victim before leaving the store . 
Little turned himself into Huntsville Police just after 9:00 p.m. 
Investigators say Sunday 's shooting stemmed from an August 2015 shooting inside a home in the 2500 block of Holmes Avenue . Little was the victim of that shooting . 
" So at this point it looks like it was just something Little 's been dwelling on . He happened to see the victim in the restaurant last night and just the anger took over I guess , and he pulled out a gun and started firing , " Lieutenant Bates said . 
Huntsville Police say the victim from the Taco Bell shooting was charged with second degree assault for that shooting . 
Little is being held in the Madison County Jail .
