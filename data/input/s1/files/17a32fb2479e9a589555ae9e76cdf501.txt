When HPD arrived at the scene , they went inside and attempted to make contact with the suspect . However , the suspect put a gun to his neck , so officers retreated , police said .

The suspect was taken in to custody after he exited the building and put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger . However , the suspect was out of bullets , so a K-9 unit was released and caught him .
