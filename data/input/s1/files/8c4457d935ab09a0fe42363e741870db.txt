SEATTLE – King County Prosecutors charged a 17-year - old shooting suspect as an adult after police said he killed his friend last Friday . 
Court documents allege Liam Carter pointed a loaded revolver at Donovan Spann and fired the weapon , killing him . 
Carter was charged with first - degree manslaughter on Wednesday . 
King County sheriff ’s deputies said Carter told detectives he and Spann were playing a modified version of Russian roulette . 
“ They weren’t making very good decisions by using a gun with ammunition to play a game like this , ” Sgt . Cindi West told Q13 News on Tuesday . 
Deputies said they got a call to 911 Friday evening saying 18-year - old Donovan Spann had been shot . 
“ They smoked a little bit of marijuana and then decided to play a modified version of Russian roulette where instead of pointing the gun at themselves , they would point the gun at each other , ” said West . 
On Wednesday prosecutors alleged Carter began CPR on Spann but stopped to stage the scene to make it appear the shooting was unintentional . 
Court documents said Carter had two outstanding warrants , and had completed deferred disposition for residential burglary . 
Prosecutors have asked for bail to be set at $ 50,000 — Carter is expected to be arraigned March 27 .
