NEW STANTON , Pa. ( AP ) â€”
A 14-year - old boy is accused of shooting his mother and 8-year - old brother once each in the forehead as they slept and calling 911 to insinuate his father did it , Pennsylvania state police said Thursday .

Jacob Remaley called 911 just before 7 a.m. Wednesday , saying his mom and younger brother were dead and his father placed a gun in his bed before leaving the house , State Police Trooper Stephen Limani said at a news conference .

Jacob later told officers he took a gun from atop the refrigerator , loaded it and then shot Dana Remaley and Caleb Remaley after his father , David , went to work , police said .
Remaley also allegedly told police he would have shot his father , too , had he been at the home , about 25 miles southeast of Pittsburgh .

An ambulance was first to arrive on the scene Wednesday .
Workers gave the teen a blanket and started to question him when he went back inside the home to get the firearm , Limani said .
Since the workers are n't trained to deal with someone with a gun , they retreated from the home until troopers responded .

During the time before troopers arrived , Jacob Remaley apparently retrieved the gun and was walking down the street carrying it when he encountered neighbor , police said .
That neighbor engaged the boy in conversation , leading him to discard the gun and approach officers , Limani said .

" That neighbor did a very good job in de - escalating the situation , " Limani said .
" The last thing we want to do is approach a 14-year - old with a firearm . "

The only indication of a motive is that the teen and his parents were n't getting along lately , Limani said .
However , his relationship with his little brother was seemingly good , especially considering their age difference , he said .

A friend of the family described Jacob Remaley as a polite , kind , straight - A student who was involved in sports and in church .

Anita Stoner told WTAE - TV
her son is a good friend of the boy 's , and she was friends with Dana Remaley .

" He 's such a good kid , " she said .
" If you could pick a friend for your kid it would be Jacob . "

She said Dana Remaley was generous and always willing to lend a hand .

" I do n't know what I 'm going to do without her , " she said .
" She was always there for me . "

Jacob Remaley was still being medically treated Thursday , and mental health evaluations were pending , Limani said .
He is awaiting arraignment on two counts each of criminal homicide and first - degree murder , charged as an adult .
No attorney information is available .
