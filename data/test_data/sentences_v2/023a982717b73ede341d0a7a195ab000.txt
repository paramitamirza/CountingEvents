The man who police said fired into the housing complex courtyard where a 16-year - old girl was shot and killed the day after Thanksgiving has turned himself in to police , a source close to the investigation told News4 .

Saeve Evans , 30 , was taken in to custody Tuesday evening , the source said .

Breyona McMillian , 16 , died after she was shot multiple times Friday morning on the 1200 block of I Street SE , near her mother 's home in the Potomac Gardens housing complex .

Evans was caught on surveillance video firing a gun multiple times near the time McMillian was shot , Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said at a news conference Tuesday morning .

" It was almost noon on a relatively nice day .
There were a number of people out there , and Saeve Evans discharged a firearm under those circumstances , which in my opinion was absolutely reckless , " Newsham said .

It was not clear whether Evans is believed to have fired the shot that killed McMillian .

Police said Tuesday morning that they issued a warrant for Evans ' arrest for unlawful possession of a firearm .
Newsham asked him to come forward .

" If he is listening and has any conscience , we ask that he turn himself in , " he said .

McMillian grew up in D.C. and was home from out of town for Thanksgiving .
She had been attending a boarding school in Iowa .
