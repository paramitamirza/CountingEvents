RBS trader : bank fired me to disguise its own failings
Ian Drysdale tells a London court he was made a scapegoat folloiwng the currency - rigging scandal
 A former trader fired by Royal Bank of Scotland has said the lender “ dishonestly contrived ” his dismissal to deflect attention from its own failings in the currency - rigging scandal .

Ian Drysdale , who worked on the foreign exchange desk , is claiming unfair dismissal in a London court after being fired in February by RBS for gross misconduct .

The bank claims Mr Drysdale used online chatrooms to share confidential information about the trading activities of clients , including Russia ’s central bank , with staff at other banks .

However , Mr Drysdale defended himself at a London tribunal hearing yesterday .

“
They had to find relevant scapegoats , of which I was one , ” he said .

“
I know I was abiding by the bank ’s laws as I interpreted them at the time .
I believe I was doing nothing wrong and still believe that .

“ I believe the real reason for my dismissal was to deflect attention from the respondent ’s ( RBS ’s ) own admitted failures , ”
Mr Drysdale said in a witness statement .

He added that RBS “ deliberately and dishonestly contrived to dismiss me for reasons unconnected to my conduct ” .

RBS , which is 73pc owned by the UK government , was fined £ 217m by the Financial Conduct Authority in November 2014 for failing to stop traders allegedly manipulating FX markets .
