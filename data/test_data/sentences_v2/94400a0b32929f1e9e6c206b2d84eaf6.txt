One dead , six injured in shooting at Peregrine Park in Natomas area
A childs birthday party at a neighborhood park in the Natomas area turned into a scene of grief and horror Saturday after gunmen attacked the party , killing one man and wounding six others , including a 7-year - old child .

About 5 p.m. , gunmen approached the party at Peregrine Park on foot and began firing , said Officer Doug Morse , Sacramento police spokesman .

They fled in a vehicle , though Morse said police were not ready to release a description of either the shooters or vehicle .

There were so many eyewitnesses, Morse said .
Detectives are trying to talk to everyone they can.
 The shooting happened at a playground with blue - and - yellow play structures and picnic tables on the edge of a newer neighborhood of stuccoed houses with tile roofs .

The victim who died was a man in his 20s .
His body lay beneath a sliding board , his face uncovered , for hours after the shooting .

A large blue Cookie Monster figure was on one of the picnic tables .
An inflatable playhouse had collapsed .
Clothing and shoes were scattered about .

Morse said the other six victims had injuries that were not life - threatening .
A 7-year - old child was among those wounded but is expected to survive , he said .

Some of those who were shot drove themselves to hospitals or were taken by friends or family members , he said .
Others went by ambulance .

Police did not identify the victims , and the Sacramento County Coroners Office had not released the name of the dead man Saturday night .

Near the park on Guadalajara Way , mourners and onlookers stood talking in small groups , some smoking cigarettes as the sun set .

At one point about , about a dozen gathered in a circle to pray with a chaplain .
A young woman leaned her head on the chaplains shoulder and sobbed .

From time to time , women wailed or cried .

Among them was Denise James , who said the man who was fatally shot was her 29-year - old son - in - law .
She said he had a young son who would now grow up without a father .

They came in the party and shot my son - in - law, James said .
They took him away too early.
