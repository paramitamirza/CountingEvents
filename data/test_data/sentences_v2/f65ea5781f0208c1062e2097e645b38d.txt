Denver Police call triple slaying “ drug deal gone extremely bad ”
Denver Police are looking for several suspects after three people were killed Friday night at a home in Park Hill in what police said Saturday afternoon was likely a “ drug deal gone extremely bad .
”
 Police said they received a call about a shooting on the 3600 block of Hudson Street at 8:13 p.m. Friday .
When they arrived , they found a man outside with a gunshot wound to the arm , and then discovered two dead people inside the home .

The man with the gunshot wound to the arm was transported to the hospital and remains in serious condition , said Denver police spokesman Tyrone Campbell .

A fourth victim was transported to the hospital by a private party , said Sonny Jackson , a Denver police spokesman .
That person later died .

The block of Hudson Street is lined by duplexes and multifamily homes with well - manicured lawns .
People were walking their dogs Saturday morning and slowing to look at crime scene technicians still working in the area .

The victims have not been identified , but Jackson said he believed they are all adult men .
Campbell said it is unclear if the men all lived in the home or not , and would not release details about what drug may have been involved .

We don’t believe it to be gang - related at this time , ” Jackson said .

Police initially said they were looking for multiple suspects , according to information they released on Twitter .
By Saturday afternoon , Campbell said police are looking for a 2015 or newer , maroon , Chevy Tahoe with temporary tags that may be traveling out of state .

“ We are looking for a person or persons of interest , ” Campbell said .
Anyone tied to that vehicle .
”

Campbell said police are still looking for more witnesses or anyone who may have information about the shooting , and encouraged anyone with information to call 911 .

Saturday morning , neighbors said the block is usually quiet , despite being a few blocks away from Holly Square .
 “
In all situations we’re always asking our community to be vigilant , ” Campbell said .
But this appears to be an arranged encounter . ”
