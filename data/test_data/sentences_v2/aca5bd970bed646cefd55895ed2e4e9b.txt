 WILLIAMSPORT -- An 8-year - old boy is recovering after being accidentally shot in the hand in Williamsport .

The question is : how did he get the gun and whose gun is it ?

It happened Monday night in Williamsport .

Police say two boys found a gun wrapped up in a duffle bag behind their homes .
They started playing with it and one of the boys ended up shooting himself in the hand .

Friends close to the victim 's family tell Newswatch 16 that whoever left the loaded gun outside could have cost a child his life .

" This could be , right now , we could be mourning a death , but right now we are praying for a child , " said a Williamsport neighbor .

The woman from Williamsport lives near where police say two boys found a .45 caliber handgun inside a duffle bag near the corner of 2nd and Locust Streets .
One of those boys ended up shooting himself in the hand .

" It 's too many kids in this 600 block of 2nd Street and our kids need to be safe . "

The woman said she is friends with the victim 's family and was there when the 8-year - old boy came home with a gunshot wound .

" For it to be a loaded gun back there where our kids was , it 's not right . "

The boys tell police they thought the pistol was a BB gun .
They started playing around with it and brought it closer to the sidewalk when it went off , shooting one of the boys in the hand .

" They had BB guns out now that look like real guns , so it could have been a mistake thinking it was a BB gun , " said Cynthia Latimer .

Latimer also lives on 2nd Street in Williamsport .
She says her neighborhood has become a dangerous place for children who want to play outside .

" The neighbors on this block need to be more precautious of who they are bringing around , because we do n't know who is doing what
or why they are doing it , " Latimer added .
" There is a mother somewhere crying and as a friend of that mother , I 'm crying . "

Friends of the victim say the boy is expected to be OK but may need reconstructive surgery on his hand
 The other boy , a 9 year old , was not hurt .

Williamsport police say the owner of the gun is from out of the area .
They are still investigating and say it 's too soon to say if charges will be filed .
