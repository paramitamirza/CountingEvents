A 16-year - old girl who fatally shot herself in the mouth was inspecting the gun when it accidently went off .
The girl died at the scene .

As the two girls hung out in a room , Weston came in , showed them the .40-caliber pistol and then left the weapon in the room when he was called away , the 18-year - old told police .

When the doomed teen picked the gun up to look at it , staring straight down the barrel , it went off , the teen told police .

Dale Weston , 42 , owned the gun and showed it to the girls before leaving the room .
During the confusion after the shooting , Weston fled the building , taking the gun with him .

At least three adults , as well as some children , were in the apartment but in other rooms when the gun went off , police sources said .

In the confusion , Weston , who has been arrested more than 20 times stretching back to 1990 , mostly for robbery and drug offenses , fled the building .

The gun also disappeared — and police believe Weston took it with him , sources said .
 “
( Weston ) is a bad guy , ” building superintendent Rafael Garcia , 30 , said in Spanish .
He leaves garbage on the floor .
He screams , speaks nasty at the children .

 Members of an NYPD Strategic Response Group were interviewing tenants and scouring for evidence both inside and outside the apartment building Friday .

her cousin Sara Gray , 22 , said .
