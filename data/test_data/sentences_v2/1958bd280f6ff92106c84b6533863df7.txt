 fearing EMPTY for her medical well - being , began calling 9 - 1 - 1 .

As the caretaker 's call EMPTY was connected to LAFD Firefighter/Dispatchers ,
 she completed her journey EMPTY to the front room , only to be confronted with
 flames .

With fire EMPTY beginning to spread rapidly in the room , the caretaker
 attempted to move the EMPTY physically infirm woman to a wheelchair as several

 Victorian - style home .

The EMPTY caretaker 's repeated attempts were unsuccessful however , and she
 was EMPTY ultimately driven back by the heat , smoke and flames before being
 forced to EMPTY flee the home unscathed .

Firefighters pulled the invalid woman from the EMPTY blaze with blinding
 speed , but not before she sustained massive second- and EMPTY third - degree
 burns from the swift - moving fire , which was confined to the room EMPTY of
 origin and extinguished in just nineteen minutes .

LAFD Paramedics EMPTY provided the burned octogenarian with skillful and
 compassionate care while EMPTY rushing her to Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in
