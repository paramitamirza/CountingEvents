A 1-year - old baby being held by his mother on a Richmond sidewalk was shot in the leg Friday by an errant bullet when someone opened fire on a man more than two blocks away , police and witnesses said .

Gunshots broke out about 10:15 a.m. on Second Street and Bissell Avenue , where a man in his 20s was shot , residents said .
A bullet that missed the man flew 2½ blocks north up Second Street and struck the infant in the leg at McDonald Avenue , said Lt .
Felix Tan , a spokesman for the Richmond Police Department .

When the shooting happened , the mother was holding her child in her arm as she waited in front of the Bay Area Rescue Mission , a food pantry and distribution center , said Leo Freels , a warehouse manager .

Freels , 45 , said he was inside the warehouse fetching a refrigerator for the mother , when co - workers told him a baby had just been shot .

“
It didn’t occur to me that the baby in her hands was shot , ” Freels said of the mother he was helping .
“ I got a baby the same age .
It ’s crazy .
”

Freels said he ran back outside and saw the injured child .
He and other workers wrapped up the baby ’s leg in bandages .
As others called 911 , Freels put the baby in his car and sped him and his mother to the Kaiser Permanente Richmond Medical Center on Nevins Avenue .

The mother “ was freaking out , but the hospital staff calmed her down , ” said Freels , adding that the mother lives in Richmond and that her baby is going to be fine .

Police did not release the names of the mother and child .

Tan said police officers went directly to the McDonald Avenue food pantry as soon as they received calls of the shooting .
While there , officers learned that a 25-year - old man had been shot at Second Street and Bissell Avenue and had already been taken to a hospital .

No suspects have been identified , he said .

The man suffered non - life - threatening injuries , Tan said .

Residents in the area where the gunfire broke out said they heard at least three shots and then saw a man on the ground wounded .

“
It ’s really frightening .
I didn’t go outside .
It ’s awful .
It was terrible , ” said Janet Hackett , 74 , who looked out her door and saw the wounded man .
