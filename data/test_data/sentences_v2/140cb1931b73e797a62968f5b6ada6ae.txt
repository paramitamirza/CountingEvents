10-Year - Old Girl Dies After Being Shot
A little girl 's struggle to survive looks to be coming to an end as an OU Medical Center supervisor said tonight her organs will be donated .
The Duncan Banner reports the 10-year - old was accidentally shot in the neck by her 12-year - old brother .

Much of the small Oklahoma town is in shock Thursday and can not believe something like this could ever happen .
Many residents we spoke with wanted to let the little girl 's family know their thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time .

Duncan resident , James Henderson , could not believe when he found out a 10-year - old girl was accidentally shot by her 12-year - old brother .

" It 's a tragic situation .
Hope people can learn from it , " said Henderson .

Henderson is a gun owner himself and his granddaughters , 11-year - old Mijal and 10-year - old Mazie , live with him and his wife .
 "
So , I 'm pretty protective of those girls .
Like I said , I do n't ...
I 'm pretty careful that they do n't stay home alone , " Henderson continued .

Across town , Oklahoma gun instructor , Stephen McCuen , said every gun owner should follow all safety guidelines ... when using and storing their firearm .

" First off , number one rule in shooting is make sure your weapon is not pointed anywhere it could cause harm , danger , or injury . â€¦
Two , you should n't have an accidental discharge if you 're following your basic gun safety rules , " McCuen stated .

Henderson said he wishes he could turn back time for this family .

" I wish it could be undone .
But , I think they are probably going through more than we could possibly realize right now over what 's happened .
I 'm sure if they could take it back , they would take it back .
The gun would n't be in the house .
But , it 's done , " Henderson declared .

He just hopes others who have guns in their homes will learn from this tragedy .

The Stephens County Sheriff 's Office is still investigating this incident .
