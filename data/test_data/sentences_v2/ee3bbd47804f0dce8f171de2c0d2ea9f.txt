Burlington firefighters stop second alarm blaze
At 0318 hours EMPTY Sunday morning , the Burlington Fire Department responded to a structure fire at 23 Front Street , across the street from the Burlington Police Station .
Police Officers pounded on doors and windows to wake the sleeping occupants .
First arriving firefighters found heavy fire blowing out of two windows on the second floor on the North Avenue side of the building , facing the Police Station .

Firefighters rescued one sleeping occupant , while other crews advanced a hose into the burning second floor apartment and knocked down the fire .

The occupants of the apartment where the fire began were awakened by their interconnected smoke alarms , in spite of the fact that both were wearing ear plugs and using their window air conditioners .
Had they relied on single station smoke alarms , it is unlikely they would have heard the alarm in time to escape .
Interconnected AC/DC smoke alarms are required in apartment buildings in Burlington , but not in all types of occupancies .
Residents who still rely on battery operated smoke alarms should consider installing AC/DC interconnected detectors , such as the ones which saved two lives in this fire .

In this case the smoke detectors used ionization technology , and they worked well .
The State of Vermont is enacting legislation which will require photoelectric smoke alarms in most new installations .

Neither tenant had renter ’s insurance , and both lost a significant portion of their belongings in the fire .
The building itself is fully insured , but the landlord ’s fire insurance only protects the building .
Renters are urged to obtain insurance to insure their property .

The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Burlington Fire Marshal ’s Office .
