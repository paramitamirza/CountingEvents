Saginaw kids looking for snake find gun instead , one child shot
( 07/21/15 ) - Children looking for snakes stumbled upon a loaded shotgun .

The shotgun went off , hurting a 9-year - old boy .

It happened Friday night at an apartment complex on Saginaw 's southeast side .

The shotgun may have been disposed of by men who lead police on a chase three weeks ago .
That was until a group of six or seven children found it .

" They all shook up about it , it 's sad , " said Kiesha Thomas , of Saginaw .

The group of young children were playing in the area of the Bridgton Place Townhomes on the southeast side of Saginaw , Friday evening .
Eight - year - old Davontae Carter was part of that group , along with friends and his 9-year - old brother .

Davontae 's mother gave us permission to speak with the child .
He says the kids were in hot pursuit of a snake in some weeds .

" We were about to find a snake , but then we found a gun , " Davontae said .
" It was a shotgun . "

Davontae says one of his friends was holding the gun when it accidentally went off .
Davontae 's 9-year - old brother was wounded in the arm .

The injury was serious enough to keep the little boy in the hospital for four days .
He is expected to be released on Tuesday .

" Kid going through something like that , with such a big gun , that 's sad , " Thomas said .

Thomas , Davontae 's aunt , says there was a police chase in the complex back on June 24 .
Police say the chase stemmed from a shooting incident on the west side of the city and ended in the complex .
Two men were arrested , but no gun was found .
Police say it 's possible the gun was thrown out of the car as the chase was coming to an end .

Thomas thinks management of the complex should have alerted residents to the potential threat .

" They could have put a note on the door , '
Well it 's suspicious
, we had a chase out here , there might be a gun laying around out here , watch your kids , keep a close eye on your kids , ' "
Thomas said .

We could not reach Bridgton Place Townhomes management for comment .

Police are still investigating .
