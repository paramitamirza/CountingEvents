( Posted on : February 13 , 2014 )

Willie Lay was in the back of the Safe and Sound Senior Citizen Social Club , playing dice , when he heard shots .
A lot of them .

" Pow , pow , pow , pow , pow , pow , pow , " said Lay , 69 , who manages the club in Gary .
" When you hear gunshots , you know what time it is .
We all ran to the closet . "

Except one of the dice players , who was still standing by the table when the gunman reached the back room .
" The guy opened the door and shot him twice , then he went back out and kept firing , " Lay said .

Everyone was on the floor but the gunman kept pulling the trigger , Lay said .
" The dude came in , told everyone to hit the floor .
But the dude does n't wait and starts shooting , " he said .
" He pointed the gun all around .
He was n't aiming . .
.
People were hollering and shots were popping . "

One of the people on the floor , a regular known as " E.C. , " 65 , had a gun of his own . "
E.C. hit the floor when this dude come in with a pistol in his hand , " Lay said .
" He got hit in the feet but he shot back . "

Another man in the club , who had been in the back with Lay , also pulled a gun and fired .
" I do n't think he hit anyone , " Lay said .

The gunman , a 23-year - old man from Chicago , stopped shooting by the time officers arrived around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday .
Also wounded were four patrons : E.C. and another Gary man , 76 ; a 45-year - old Chicago man ; and a 43-year - old East Chicago man , according to police .

All five were taken to Gary Methodist Hospital , where E.C. underwent surgery .
One of the victims was airlifted to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood , three others were stabilized at Gary Methodist and one was treated and released , according to a hospital administrator .

The gunman was in custody at the hospital .
Police were trying to determine whether he acted alone , according to Cpl .
Gabrielle King of the Gary Police Department .

" When he came in he told everybody to get on the floor and he had a gun .
He was armed with a weapon , " King said .
" Someone from inside the social club returned fire and shot the suspect . "

Lay believes at least two other people were with the gunman but got locked out .
The gunman apparently got into the club through an exit as a patron was leaving , and the door locked behind him , Lay said .

People outside said they saw two men with guns trying to get in , then running away .
" If they all got in , there might have been bodies stacked up , " Lay said .
" I do n't think it was a random stick - up . "

Lay said both patrons who fired back had permits to carry guns .

He said the club has not had any trouble in the past .
He did n't see the gunman and does n't know if he had ever been there .

" This is an old folks club , " he said .
" We come down and have some fun . "
