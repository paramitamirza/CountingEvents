Community reacts to 4th suspect arrested in 7-year - old girl 's de - WMC Action News 5 - Memphis , Tennessee
The murder of two young Memphis girls are connected now that police officers arrested the brother of 15-year - old Cateria Stokes , who was shot in the head as she slept in her bed on April 10 .
Carlos Stokes is charged in connection with the murder of 7-year - old Kirsten Williams .
Kirsten 's family said they are relieved to hear of a new arrest Thursday , but like neighbors , they 're still praying for peace and begging for justice."I went across there to go and see the little girl , and it just tore me apart , " said Kirsten 's neighbor , Larry Baker .
Baker was on his front porch when the 7-year - old was gunned down during a drive - by shooting two weeks ago .
Investigators have not yet said whether Williams was the intended target."The blood was running down the sidewalk and I had never hurt like that in my life , " Baker recalled .
Carlos Stokes was arrested Thursday morning and charged with first - degree murder .
Witnesses told police that Stokes planned the shooting and also opened fire .
He is the fourth suspect arrested in connection with the 7-year - old 's murder .
Carlos Stokes is confirmed to be 15-year - old 's Cateria Stokes ' brother , who lived at the same house where she was shot and killed earlier in the day.“If
you knew who shot your sister , do n't go and shoot another innocent child , that 's not right , ” said Kim Taylor , Carlos Stokes ' neighbor .
Three other men were charged last week in Williams ' death .
Police say they are known gang members .
Investigators say it 's not clear if the 7-year - old girl was the intended target.“You've got two innocent young children caught up in something they probably did n't know anything about , ” said Taylor .
A man was shot on the same street the day before the 7-year - old was killed .
However , it 's not clear if that shooting led up to what some neighbors are calling " retaliation shootings."“Shooting a child is messed up , ” said neighbor Erico Marion.“It 's like the children just getting out of hand , they 're out of control , ” said Taylor .

" If anything happened to me I would n't be coming back retaliating with a pistol or a gun , I 'll try to get back to the bottom of it with the police department , " said Baker .
