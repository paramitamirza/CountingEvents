The boyfriend of a woman whose 2-year - old son shot himself in the face at a Seattle motel was charged Tuesday with unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree .

According to charging documents filed in King County Superior Court , the toddler , his mother and her boyfriend , Francois Cunningham , 57 , of Seattle , had checked into the Munson Motel on East Marginal Way on Friday .

The couple were still there and asleep about 9 a.m. Monday when , prosecutors say , the toddler found a loaded .40 caliber Glock handgun and shot himself in the face .

The child was taken to Harborview Medical Center , where police were called , court documents say .

The hospital did not release the boy ’s condition , but police investigators said in the certification for determination of probable cause that the child is expected to survive .

According to prosecutors , Cunningham is a “ career criminal ” with felony convictions for burglary and drugs who is banned from possessing firearms .

The boy ’s mother , who denied knowing there was a gun in the hotel room , told police that Cunningham had been jealous because he believed she was trying to rekindle a relationship with her children ’s father .

Cunningham is scheduled to be arraigned July 25 .
