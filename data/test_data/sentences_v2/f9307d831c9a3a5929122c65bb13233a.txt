Toddler finds gun in car , shoots grandmother in back - | WBTV Charlotte
A Rock Hill grandmother is recovering after police say a 2-year - old boy found a gun inside a car and shot her in the back .

According to police , officers were called to the 1100-block of Stanley Drive Sunday afternoon around 1:24 p.m.
 Officers met with a woman who says she picked up her great - nephew and was driving him around , with his grandmother in the passenger seat .

While she was driving , the young boy found a .357 revolver in the pouch on the back of the passenger seat .
He then accidentally shot his 40-year - old grandmother through the passenger seat .

" She ’s probably lucky that it hit the car seat first because it slowed down the momentum of the bullet , " said Rock Hill Police Captain Mark Bollinger .

The family was traveling through the light at Ogden Road and Heckle Boulevard when the woman heard the gun go off .

She looked in the back seat and the boy had the gun in both hands and began to cry .
That 's when the grandmother said she 'd been hit by the bullet in the back .

" It was in a pouch behind the passenger seat , somehow the child reached in and got ahold of it , that ’s something our detectives are working on today , " Bollinger said .

The woman reportedly drove to a family member 's home along Stanley Drive and called police .

The grandmother was transported to Carolinas Medical Center - Main in Charlotte .

There was earlier confusion from police on the age of the boy and the relationship to the woman who was shot .

Investigators will turn over case findings to the solicitor ’s office for possible weapons or other charges .

" There could be some child neglect , or some unlawful conduct towards a child charges based on the age of the child and leaving the gun within reaching distance of a young minor , " Bollinger said .

While the injuries aren’t believed to be life threatening , Bollinger says the incident is a reminder for parents to keep their guns locked and stowed away from children .

" We encourage people to get gun locks , we give them away free here at the Rock Hill Police Department , "
Bollinger said .

Family members and neighbors did not want to talk about what happened .

The case remains under investigation .
