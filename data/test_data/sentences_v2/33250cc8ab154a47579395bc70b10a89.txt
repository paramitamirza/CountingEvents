 RIGBY —
The man who was shot in the foot Saturday after a toddler found a gun in a Rigby home says he was not at fault .

This wasn’t my house , this wasn’t my gun , I was helping a friend move , ”

I have gotten so much negative feedback from this , even death threats from people .
”
 Rigby police spokesperson Carol Shackelford confirmed Sorensen ’s version of events .
She said he ’s “ absolutely the victim here .
”
 Sorensen told EastIdahoNews that another man who was helping move had placed the gun on the floor .

I don’t know why he did that , ”

Later he was awoken by a loud noise and pain in his foot .

A child in the room above Sorensen fired the gun into the floor .

I just want people to know that I had nothing to do with this gun being placed on the floor , I knew nothing about it , ” Sorensen said .
I just want it to be clear that I was the victim of circumstances , not at fault for negligence .
