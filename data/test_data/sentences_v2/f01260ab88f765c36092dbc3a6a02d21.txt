Police : Argument over skateboard led to shooting
A fight over a skateboard may have led to the shooting death of an Albuquerque teen this past weekend , police said .

Jaquise Lewis , 17 , was shot and killed at Los Altos Skate Park on Sunday .
Six others were injured in the shooting , ranging in age from 17 - 27 years of age .
One of the men injured remains hospitalized in critical condition .

The park is located near Eubank and Lomas boulevards .

On Monday , police said the shooting was possibly gang - related .
On Tuesday , however , they said though individuals who may associate themselves with gang activity were present , a fist fight over the skateboard appears to be the cause of the gunplay .

They said multiple shooters fired multiple rounds , though no arrests have been made .
Witnesses recalled hearing as many as 20 shots fired around 10 p.m.

One woman , who was at the park with her children , said there were two groups on separate sides of the park .
At one point , the groups got into an argument , and that ’s when the shooting started , she said .

According to police , two separate groups were celebrating birthday parties at the park Sunday evening .
