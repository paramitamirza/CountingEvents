Police : child shot & killed lived inside drug , gang home
DAYTON , Ohio ( WDTN ) –
The Dayton Police Department addressed the media for the first time Wednesday about the investigation into a weekend shooting that killed 5-year - old Maleki Parker .

Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl discussed gun crime , including the East Bruce Avenue incident that resulted in the death of Parker .

“ It ’s not the first time I have come before the media to talk about a brutal death , ” the chief said .
“ It should not happen .
This shouldn’t be what happens in a compassionate community and yet we are here talking about it again .
”

Biehl detailed that in February a nuisance abatement ordinance was issued for the home .
Neighbors appear to have known the home was a drug house , according to officials .
The chief confirmed the address is a drug , gun and gang home .
Inside , officers retrieved heroin , crack cocaine and pills .
A police report obtained by 2 NEWS shows ammunition and at least one handgun was also taken as evidence .

Biehl explained that nationwide there has been an increasing trend of violence with injuries , often including guns .
In Dayton , in May of 2015 the number of incidents involving guns nearly doubled compared to last year .
Biehl said the data collected doesn’t reveal why there has been this increase in Dayton .

There are no suspects at this time , but several persons of interest .

According to police , Parker was sitting in his living room Saturday night when four bullets went through the home , one striking him in the head .
The boy ’s death is being ruled a homicide , according to the Montgomery County Coroner ’s Office .

Tuesday night a walk was held in the neighborhood and community members upset about gun violence .
They were joined by city officials , including Mayor Nan Whaley , and law enforcement officials , including both the Montgomery County Sheriff ’s Office and Dayton Police Department .
