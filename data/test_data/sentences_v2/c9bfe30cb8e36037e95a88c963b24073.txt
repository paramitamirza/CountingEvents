Her organs were donated .

Makanzee ’s birthday would have been June 13 .
A GoFundMe page has been set up to help with medical and funeral expenses .

Anger over a stolen thousand dollars and Kool - Aid spilled on a teen 's prom dress escalated to the fatal shooting of the girl Wednesday , according to family members of two brothers charged Saturday in 34th District Court in Romulus .

Yvette Johnson wept as her sons Antoine Smelley , 33 , and Cleveland Smelley , 31 , were arraigned along with 21-year - old Deonta Bennett , on a total of 14 charges , including 7 charges of assault to commit murder .

It was unclear Sunday whether the charges would be amended in light of Oldham ’s death .

She is the latest child to fall victim to Detroit ’s violence .
In the past two months , eight youths have been injured or killed by gunfire .

It is alleged that Antoine Smelley was at a home in the 16400 block of Fairmount , ” Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in the release . “
He poured juice over the head of a woman who was getting ready to leave the house to go to a prom .

“ Antoine Smelley pulled out a handgun and threatened the young woman and her friends .

 “
During the fight , it is alleged that Bennett gave a handgun to Cleveland Smelley , who shot at seven people in a car , ” including Makanzee .

Relatives of the Smelley brothers gave a different account Saturday .
They said the girl whose prom dress was ruined stole $ 1,000 from Antoine Smelley .
The girl ’s relatives allegedly “ ambushed ” and assaulted Antoine Smelley at his home after the Kool - Aid incident , the Smelley family members said .
Cleveland Smelley and Deonta Bennett then went to Antoine Smelley ’s house , where the incidents occurred , to protect Antoine .
 “
Everybody should be looked at , ” said Brittney Johnson , 23 , who said she was the Smelley brothers’ sister .
Antoine was at his own home when this happened .

“ They brought their babies to the fight .
”

A cousin , Kamika Smelley , said the accused men " are not as bad as the media is making them out to be . "
 “ ( The girl in the prom dress ’s ) family members came to Antoine ’s house .
It was to defend themselves , ”
Kamika Smelley said .
It was 11 people on two guys , guys and girls .

" It all got out of hand , " she said .
