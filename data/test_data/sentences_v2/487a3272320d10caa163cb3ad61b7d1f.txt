 A 17-year - old sophomore at McGavock High School in Nashville is charged with criminal homicide for the fatal shooting of a fellow student at an apartment complex in Hermitage Tuesday evening .

Police said Kaemon Robinson was playing with a pistol inside the Burning Tree Apartments around 7 p.m. when it discharged , striking 15-year - old Kevin Barbee in the face .
Barbee , also a sophomore at McGavock , was rushed to Summit Medical Center where he was pronounced dead .

Robinson , who police say was a friend of Barbee 's , fled the apartment before police arrived .

According to police , his attorney , Kyle Mothershead , contacted authorities overnight saying that Robinson wished to surrender .

The teen and his mother then met detectives inside their apartment at the Burning Tree complex , a different location than where the shooting occurred .
Robinson reportedly declined to give a statement upon his arrest .

The pistol used in the shooting has yet to be recovered .

News 2 spoke with James Glass Jr. who was friends with both Barbee and Robinson .

" We do n't know if it 's his [ gun ] or if he borrowed it from somebody .
He just pulled it out and that 's when I heard the bang . "

Glass told News 2 he and the two McGavock students were hanging out in his bedroom when the deadly shooting occurred .

He said he did not see the two interacting with the gun because he was playing a video game and listening to music , however he did hear the gun shot .

" When I seen him hit the ground , I already knew what happened , " Glass recalled .

Glass , who tried to administer CPR on his dying friend , said the shooting was accidental , but feels Robinson made a mistake when left the scene .
 "
He should have just stayed , but now he got himself in a worse situation by running away , " said Glass .

Glass ' father , James Glass , Sr . , was not at the apartment at the time of the shooting .

He told Nashville 's News 2 his son is cooperating with police and that he hopes others will learn from the tragic incident .

" When you play with guns these are the consequences from playing with guns , " said James Glass Sr .

Robinson 's attorney released a statement regarding the incident involving his client saying , " This was a terrible accident .
The gun was not Kaemon 's and he believed that it was not loaded .
He never meant to fire it .
He considered Kevin a friend and he did not mean to hurt him .
Kaemon deeply regrets this tragedy and expresses his utmost sorrow to Kevin 's family . "

Many students at McGavock High School took their thoughts and prayers to Twitter overnight , remembering Barbee as having a good sense of humor and enjoyed making others laugh .

Robbin Wall , the principal of McGavock , said the Metro Schools Crisis Team was on campus Wednesday to support and help students and staff .

Metro Schools spokesperson , Joe Bass , added , " We are very saddened to learn about the death of a McGavock High School student last night .
This young man 's life was just getting started , and his passing is a great tragedy . "

Robinson is scheduled for a detention hearing Friday at 2:30 p.m.

The shooting remains under investigation .

President Barack Obama will be in Nashville Thursday to speak at McGavock High School .
