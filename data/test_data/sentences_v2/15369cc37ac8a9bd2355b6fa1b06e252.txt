The 6-year - old girl suffered a graze wound to the back of her head .
Eric Wright , 26 , and Larry Watkins Jr. 26 , were also injured .
All three were taken to the hospital and are in stable condition .

Officials said they were visiting friends .

" I do n't want no violence .
I get rid of them if they cause problems , " Sealey Apartments owner Roosevelt Sealey said .

Very close call for her .
It was unfortunate she was involved , " said Detective Evelyn Estevez with the Altamonte Springs Police Department .
