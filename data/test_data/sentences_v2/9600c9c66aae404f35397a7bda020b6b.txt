 Late Wednesday , Chicago Police said they were questioning a person of interest in the case .

The boy was shot in the back while playing outside in the 5700 block of South Morgan around 5:30 p.m. , when a vehicle drove by and someone inside opened fire .
 “
I heard 4 shots
then I came out the house , and I saw people putting a little kid in the car , ” said Englewood resident Alexis Burns .

Sources tell CBS 2 ’s Audrina Bigos that the home has been a target for gun violence in the past .
Bullet holes were visible on the exterior of the residence .

Family members took the boy to Saint Bernard Hospital , which immediately transferred him to Comer Children ’s Hospital .
He was listed in serious condition .

Some witnesses said the boy was playing on the sidewalk when he was shot ; others said he was on the family ’s porch .

Regardless , Englewood Political Task Force President Darryl Smith said it ’s intolerable .

Smith said something must change , but not necessarily gun laws .

“
You can take all the guns away you want .
You can take this gun , I’m going to go find another one .
You can take this gun , I’m going to go find another one .
It ’s the person , it ’s not the gun .
It ’s the person that has the gun , that pulls the trigger , that sees a child on the porch , and shoots up there anyway ; that ’s the problem , ” Smith said .

He said police must sit with the shooters .
 “
When they come in these rooms , they don’t go get Joe Schmoe , they don’t go get Ms. Johnson , Ms. Smith , Ms. Jones .
They go get who they want to go get , and bring them in the room , and they just talk about the same thing they’ve been talking about for the last 20 years , and nothing ’s been resolved .
Go to the grassroots , and get the people who know …
what ’s going on in the streets , ” he said .

The boy shot in Englewood is at least the fourth child under the age of 8 to be shot on the South Side in the last eight days .

On Monday , two cousins , ages 5 and 8 , were also shot in Englewood .

On June 28 , 4-year - old Kevan Collins was shot in the face while walking with his family and a friend , after leaving a nearby park so his mother could change his baby brother ’s diaper .
A bullet grazed Kevan ’s face .
He was taken to Comer Children ’s Hospital , where he was listed in serious but stable condition the day after the shooting .
