Two - year - old child shot in the chest in Palm Harbor
A 2-year - old boy in Tarpon Springs died Wednesday after deputies say he got his father ’s gun from a glove box and accidentally shot himself in the chest .

Kaleb Ahles entered the vehicle outside his family ’s home and apparently got the .380-caliber weapon from the secured glove box where it had been placed by his father , Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said .
 “
It ’s just one of those things that happens where everything lines up the wrong way , ”
Gualtieri said at a news conference .
You had a 2 1/2 year old who was able to take a gun , pick it up , turn it around and he shot himself dead center in the middle of the chest . ”
 “
There ’s no indication that anyone did anything wrong , ” he said .
There ’s no indication of any criminal activity or negligence .
The family was in the middle of moving from a home at 1094 Misty Hollow Court in the East Lake neighborhood of Tarpon Springs about 5 p.m. and many relatives were on the property .
In a statement released Wednesday evening detailing the incident , the Sheriff ’s Office says the child was able to get into the vehicle at some point as the family loaded it for moving .

Witnesses , the sheriff said , told investigators the child was in a vehicle alone .

All evidence as of Wednesday night showed the weapon was “ secured , it looks like in the glove box itself , ” Gualtieri said .
Sometimes just bad things happen .
“ We’re trying to get information from people who traumatized , and it ’s tough to get some of this information , ”
the sheriff said in response to questions about the gun ’s location .
“ But again all the evidence points to the fact that it was in the glove box , that it wasn’t anywhere else .
That it wasn’t carelessness .
Kevin Ahles , 23 , the father , turned away from his child and heard the gunshot , the sheriff said .

“ [ The child ] probably barely got the trigger pulled , but it was enough to fire the gun and kill him , ” the sheriff said .

The child ’s mother , Christina Nigro , 23 , began performing CPR , and other neighbors tried to help until paramedics arrived , he said .
Kaleb was pronounced dead at Trinity Hospital .

The sheriff does not anticipate filing charges .

“ I don’t think anyone could punish these parents any more than what they’ve been punished , ” he said .
