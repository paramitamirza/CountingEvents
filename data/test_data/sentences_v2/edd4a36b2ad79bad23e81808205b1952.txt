5 shot in Uptown : ' A constant bang , bang , bang '
5 shot in Uptown : ' A constant bang , bang , bang '
 Five men went down as the car made a U - turn on Wilson Avenue and sped off , leaving a trail of nearly two dozen shell casings .
Inside the church , speakers thought the shots were firecrackers and services continued for several more minutes .

People were gathered on the steps of the Uptown Baptist Church for prayer and a free meal Monday evening when a white sedan pulled up and someone inside sprayed the street with a high - powered rifle .

Five people were shot at the intersection of Wilson Avenue and Sheridan Road in the Uptown neighborhood .
( Nuccio DiNuzzo , Chicago Tribune )
 " It was a constant bang , bang , bang , " said Joseph Rogers , a security guard at the nearby Uptown Shop & Save at Wilson and Sheridan Road .

He rushed outside to see the white car fleeing west on Wilson and one wounded man on the church steps and three others on the street .
" There was blood everywhere , " Rogers said .

Police say five men between the ages of 21 and 58 were shot .
The youngest victim was shot in the head and was in critical condition at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center , authorities said .
Police initially said the man had died .

Three other victims were brought to Weiss Memorial Hospital : a 44-year - old man shot in the knee , a 58-year - old man shot in the hand and a 32-year - old man shot in the ankle .
All were in good condition , police said .
A 26-year - old man was shot in both arms and was reported stable at Illinois Masonic .

Police say the shooting was sparked by a conflict between two gangs in that section of Uptown , and patrols have been watching for any retaliation .
The shooting occurred along a Safe Passage route mapped by Chicago Public Schools for the coming year .
The getaway car was also found along the route , at McCutcheon Elementary School , 4865 N. Sheridan Rd .

The route has been laid out for children who are transfering to Brenneman Elementary this year from Stewart Elementary , one of dozens of schools closed by CPS.

A hearing officer , retired Cook County Judge Charles Winkler , had opposed the closing of Stewart , saying school officials and police could not guarantee the safety of school children who will now have to walk farther to school .

“ Is there really enough time to get everyone up to speed so the 14,400 children from the closing schools are provided safe passage , ” Winkler wrote .
" Will an understaffed Chicago Police Department be able to provide enough officers to assist the Stewart children ?
Will CPS hire a private security company to furnish properly trained personnel ? "

Mayor Rahm Emanuel acknowledged today that the shooting was " an early warning sign to all of us to be more on our toes than we were already on our toes . "

Monday 's shooting occurred shortly before 6 p.m. as the church was holding a prayer service where meals are offered to the homeless .
Monday was taco night .

Eric Ray said he heard the shooting from the front pews .
He said he frequents the neighborhood but avoids lingering at Wilson and Sheridan .
