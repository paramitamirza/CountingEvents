 NEWBURGH , N.Y. â€”
Police are questioning two people in connection with a shooting at a Newburgh Halloween party that left two women dead and five people injured Sunday morning .

" This is Newburgh where everyone has a gun , " a grieving Miguel Cruz told PIX11 .
" They do n't believe in solving anything any other way .
Newburgh 's where dreams die and my dream just died . "

The shooting happened around 12:45 a.m. on Broadway .
Police said it happened inside an apartment building during a Halloween party .

Tabitha Cruz , 20 , was one of the women killed when gunfire erupted .

" That was my world , my baby , " Cruz said of his daughter Tabitha .

" There were between 13 to 15 shots fire , everybody running , " Denesha Thompson , a Newburgh parent told PIX11 .
" It was a stampede . "

The other woman killed was Omani Free , 18 , a senior at Newburgh Free Academy .
Free had dreams of going to art school and becoming a designer .

" It had nothing to do with her , " Rhonda Valentine - Free , the victim 's mother told PIX11 .
" Someone decided to pull out a gun .
Omani just happened to be the first victim , " the tearful mother added .

" This is some senseless mess that needs to stop , " Omar Free , the victim 's father , told PIX11 .

Friends gathered to mourn and worry about the five injured by gunfire , some who are still recovering at Saint Luke 's Cornwall Hospital .

One Newburgh parent who worked with both of the victims in a community outreach program called " We Are Newburgh " said parents in this city need to spend more time with their children .

" We need to unify , " said community volunteer Joe Alvarez .
" We need to be parents .
We need to show them a better life . "
