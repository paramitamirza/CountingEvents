Historic Tualatin , Ore. , landmark burns
At 11:30 pm Wednesday evening , Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue was dispatched to a reported structure fire adjacent to the Big K Shopping Center off Nyberg Road in Tualatin .
First arriving crews found heavy fire engulfing the first floor of the vacant and boarded - up historic Nyberg House located an an overgrown piece of land near the I-5 and Nyberg Road interchange .

Due to the heavy volume of fire throughout the first and portions of the second story , the threat of a roof collapse , and the longtime vacant status of the structure , firefighters fought the fire defensively from the exterior .
Because the house is known to have some transient activity , firefighters quickly searched an adjacent building next to the main house , but found no evidence of anyone inside .

On scene , firefighters had to contend with energized power lines overhead .
Once PGE arrived on scene and disconnected power to the overhead lines , TVF&R was able to utilize a truck with a 100 foot ladder to extinguish the remaining fire in the upper stories .
As of 1:30 am , firefighters were continuing to battle hot spots throughout the structure .
Approximately 25 firefighters responded to the incident .

The cause of the fire remains under investigation and a damage estimate is unknown at this time .
The 102 year - old structure was once the home of the city 's second mayor , John Nyberg .
Nyberg and his wife Ora built the home in 1905 .
The house along with 126 acres of land along the Tualatin River was home to the Nybergs and their 10 children .
In 1915 the family moved the three - story house a short distance to the west to its current site when I-5 was built .
John served as mayor of Tualatin from 1918 to 1944 .
