UPDATED : Wife , then husband , shot McCloud
Eight days after he escaped from the Warren County Jail , Rafael McCloud ’s luck ran out .

McCloud , 34 , was found dead about 7 a.m. Thursday in the tub of a bathroom of a home he broke into , shot by the residents .

According to Vicksburg police , McCloud was holding the couple and their 5-year - old son in the bathroom , when he allowed the wife to leave .
She returned with a handgun and fired one shot , which she believed to hit McCloud .
After she freed her husband , he took the gun and fired additional shots at McCloud .
The family left the house and ran outside , where they flagged down a passing motorist and asked them to call 911 .

McCloud was found in the bathtub with multiple gunshot wounds , including one to the head .
He was declared dead at the scene by deputy Warren County corner Kelda Bailess .
An autopsy was ordered .

His death ends a round - the - clock search for him that began March 2 when he overpowered a jail guard and managed to slip out a side door at the jail .

“ This is certainly not how we wanted this to end , ” said Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace .
Our goal was to take him back into custody and have him stand before a jury in Warren County .
But he brought this upon himself .

“ We are incredibly relieved this family was not seriously injured and they were able to protect themselves this morning , ” Pace said .
“ It ’s been a long week for this community and we appreciate the cooperation of the public as we have pursued this community .
”

Vicksburg Police Chief Walter Armstrong said authorities believe McCloud had help while he was on the lam in avoiding authorities .

He had on tennis shoes ; nice , white tennis shoes and a pair of blue jeans , so there is some indication someone has been helping him or he stole those items , ” the chief said .
But the shoes looked to be the exact size he wears . ”

He added police received several reports that McCloud had been seen in the Fort Hill area , including a report he was seen around the McNutt House , a historic home on First East Street .
He said police were checking other homes on Fort Hill Drive to see if McCloud might have attempted to or broke in them .

McCloud was shot several hours after he broke into the home in the 600 block of Fort Hill Drive about 4 a.m. Thursday , fought with the homeowner and his wife and held them hostage until they were able to get free and shoot McCloud .
Armstrong said the man suffered a non - lifethreatening stab wound and was taken to Merit Health River Region Medical Center for treatment .
His wife was hit it the head during a fight with McCloud , but did not have to go to the hospital .

Armstrong said McCloud entered the house through an unlocked door and attacked the husband when he was on his way to the garage to start his wife ’s car .
The man and his wife both fought McCloud before he was able to subdue them .

McCloud was awaiting trial for capital murder and other charges in the June 28 abduction and death of Sharen Wilson .
He escaped from the jail about 5:30 a.m. March 2 after using a shank , or homemade knife , to assault and overpower one of the three guards on duty at the jail .

Sheriff ’s deputies assisted by Vicksburg police and state and federal law enforcement agencies concentrated their efforts in the northern part of the city , where authorities said he was known to have lived and has friends and relatives .

Search teams also multiple times revisited the Kuhn Memorial Hospital property , where McCloud is accused of killing Wilson , and where officers March 3 found a pair of pants he took from the jail guard .

Teams Friday searched all three buildings on the property floor - by - floor in an effort to find him .
Thursday , they used a Mississippi Highway Patrol infrared - equipped helicopter to scan the building and other areas without results .

McCloud , who had been in the Warren County Jail since his arrest June 29 , was indicted in January on multiple counts involving Wilson ’s death , and has prior felony convictions for auto burglary , grand larceny and armed robbery , according to court records .
