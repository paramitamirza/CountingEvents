3-year - old shot , killed in Stockon while riding in car
A 3-year - old girl was shot and killed while riding in a car with her family , Stockton police said .

" ( It was a ) senseless act of violence committed by cowards with guns , " Stockton police spokesman Joe Silva said .
" Anytime there is a loss of life , it 's a tragedy .
But , when it involves a 3-year - old little girl , that hits the whole community really hard .
"

The family was driving about 8:26 p.m. Sunday in the 1100 block of South Commerce Street when gunshots were fired from a dark sedan that began following their vehicle , officers said .
The shooter 's vehicle was either a black Monte Carlo or a Camaro , with tinted windows , police said .

The girl , identified as Melanie Martinez of Stockton , was the only person in the vehicle who was hit by the shots , and her family drove her straight to a nearby hospital , according to police .
She was pronounced dead at the hospital .

" Once I heard it was a 3-year - old little girl , I was furious .
I was just furious and devastated , "
neighbor Cynthia Flores said .
" It could have been my daughter .
It could have been anybody here .
It could have been anybody in any of these houses living there .
All you 're doing is living your life ( and ) all of a sudden you got a gunshot through the head . "

Investigators focused their search for evidence Monday morning along Commerce Street , between West Jackson and West Jefferson .

" This is where they believe the shooting happened , " Silva said .
" ( We 're ) still searching and processing the area for evidence .
The preliminary investigation is indicating the victim vehicle did not appear to be the intended target .
They were just driving by and got caught in the middle of gunfire .
"
 Officers do not believe the vehicle was in the intended target of the gunshots .

They have no suspect descriptions at this time .

" Our detectives are going to work around the clock until they can figure out who did this to this 3-year - old little girl , " Silva said .
" They 're going to be relentless in their investigations because we owe that to that family . "

Anyone with information about the shooting is urged to call the Stockton Police Department at 209 - 937 - 8377 .
