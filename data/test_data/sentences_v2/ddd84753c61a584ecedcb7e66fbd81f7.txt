Judge dismisses evidence in Acerra whistleblower case
FREEHOLD â€”
A state Superior Court judge sided with the City of Long Branch Tuesday dismissing several pieces of evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit brought against the city by a former employee .

Julie Acerra was the city 's principal personnel clerk from 1995 until she was laid off in 2011 , according to her complaint .
She claims the city fired her for whistleblowing acts she took during her employment , in violation of the state 's Conscientious Employee Protection Act ( CEPA ) .

The act offers protection for employees for retaliation if they disclose an act they reasonably believe is illegal or fraudulent .

State Superior Court Judge Thomas F. Scully barred EMPTY Acerra from being able to assert evidence in the upcoming trial that she was fired for cooperating in the FBI 's Operation Bid Rig investigation in 2005 .
Scully said her doing so did not constitute a whistleblowing act .
 "
Mrs. Acerra did not seek out , did not initiate any form of interview or conversation with the FBI.
That was initiated by the FBI , and she was a responder , not an initiator of that conversation , " said Scully .

Operation Bid Rig was the state 's largest federal corruption sting , targeting dozens of politicians and officials in Monmouth and Ocean counties and elsewhere in the state .

Scully ruled Acerra claim of cooperation in the investigation was lacking specificity .
" It 's not clear at all what the general subject of that conversation , " with federal agents was about .

All told , Scully granted seven of the city 's eight motions to exclude evidence .
Acerra 's attorney , Richard J. Shaklee , said the decisions leave them with fewer options to argue before the jury .

" Certainly , by the nature of it , there are less things we are going to present now , " said Shaklee .

Shaklee said he will be able to present evidence on another of their major CEPA claims .
In 2007 , Acerra called into question the city 's chief finance officer Ronald Mehlhorn 's receipt of checks worth $ 200,000 , payment for 400 accrued sick days .
She claimed the sick days were not properly accounted for .

The city 's attorney , Mitchell B. Jacobs , said the city denies the allegations .

Jury selection is scheduled for Wednesday .
