13-month - old girl shot in Lakeland home
A 13-month - old girl was shot and taken to Lakeland Regional Health Center Monday , Lakeland police said .

The baby was treated for non - life - threatening injuries , police said .

Her mother , Tylashia Sha'crystal Davis , met with officers at the hospital .

Davis said that she was at work when her friend , who was house - sitting for her , called and said that Davis ' child had been shot .

The friend told officers that she was sleeping and was awakened by a 17-year - old boy , who said the 13-month - old was bleeding from her leg .
The friend said that she immediately took the baby to the hospital .
The friend told officers that she did not hear a gunshot .

The 17-year - old said that he was outside of the apartment on the porch when he heard a loud pop .
He said he entered the apartment and saw the baby sitting on the floor in front of a couch bleeding .

The teen said that he saw a small caliber handgun in the hands of a 3-year - old , who is the brother of the 13-month - old .

The teen said he did not remember who took the handgun from the 3-year - old or where the handgun came from .

Davis said she did not have a handgun in the apartment .
