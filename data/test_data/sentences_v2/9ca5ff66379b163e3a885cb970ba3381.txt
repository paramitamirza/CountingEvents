Suspect charged in death of baby Bill Thao
A 21-year - old suspect was charged Friday in the shooting death of 13-month - old Bill Thao .

Darmequaye Cohill is accused of firing into the home on 73rd Street and Mill Road on Dec. 27 .
Cohill faces a charge of first - degree reckless homicide .

The boy was conscious and breathing when he was taken from the scene to a hospital , but died from his injuries later .

Cohill is also accused of firing shots into a neighboring home on Dec. 28 and was charged with recklessly endangering safety .

A commissioner set a $ 500,000 cash bail for Cohill .
He said he was concerned about the nature of the allegations against Cohill , as well as two pending cases to which Cohill is believed to be connected .

Authorities believe Cohill went after a rival drug dealer who was allegedly stealing his business and shooting at what he thought was the dealer ’s home .

However , Cohill is suspected to have shot at the wrong home and fired into the child ’s house .

Somboon Thao , Bill ’s father , said having this happen between Christmas and New Year ’s Day will make the memory difficult to live with .
 “
Everyone that I know has broken heart because of what he did , so that ’s the only way I want him to know , ” Thao said .
