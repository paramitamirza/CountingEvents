Police : No link between 2 weekend shootings in Champaign
CHAMPAIGN , Ill. ( AP ) - Champaign police now believe two weekend shootings that left one man dead and four people wounded were not related .

But on Tuesday police spokeswoman LaEisha Meaderds said interviews with witnesses about the second shooting led investigators to conclude there was no link .

One man , 22-year - old George Korchev of Mundelein , died in the first shooting and three other people were injured .
Police said all four were just passing by the apartment where the large party was held .

The later shooting west of the campus injured another person .
