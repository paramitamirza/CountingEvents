Investigators received several good tips on the suspects .
One informant said Castillo ’s killer goes by the nickname “ Kiwi , ” according to the probable cause statement .

Another tip came from a driver robbed in another case .
She tracked her attackers , which led police to Battles’ front door , prosecutors said in court .

“ She used a GPS application on her cellular phone and tracked the telephone to a location in Humble , Texas , which that address goes back to defendant Philip Battles , ” the prosecutor said in court on Friday .

Investigators said Battles , who was arrested on a separate capital murder charge , admitted robbing the driver and also Castillo ’s mom .
