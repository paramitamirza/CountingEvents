Teen charged with felony in shooting death of best friend
STERLING –
The tall , thin brown - haired boy stared down at the table as the charge against him was read : felony reckless conduct .

Brady Osborne , 16 – dressed in blue and surrounded by his parents and grandparents – sat opposite the family of the boy he is accused of accidentally killing , his best friend .

Matt Anderson , 15 , died nearly 6 months ago , on March 1 , killed by a gunshot wound to his chest .

Whiteside County prosecutors say Osborne , the son of Illinois State Police trooper Troy Osborne , caused great bodily harm to Anderson after he picked up a loaded Glock handgun to show him , and the gun discharged .

Anderson was taken to CGH Medical Center in Sterling , where he later died .

Were he being tried as an adult , reckless conduct would carry the minimal felony sentence , 1 to 3 years in prison .

Because he is a juvenile , Osborne faces , among other things , probation or incarceration with the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice , until he turns 21 .

Sauk Valley Media is publishing the name of the boy because he is charged with a felony in an incident involving a death .

The investigation into what happened between the two boys at the Osbornes ' Rock Falls home on that spring day has been a long one , although investigators immediately characterized it as an accident .

The community was hit hard by the tragedy .
Anderson was a well - liked Rock Falls High School freshman and an athlete .
In the days following his death , students took to wearing the school colors – black and green – in his memory .

Black and green flooded community social media pages , too , with users replacing their profile pictures with a black and green image in Anderson 's honor .

A final tweet Anderson sent at the end of January now has a poignant ring to it .

" When someone says I love you , appreciate it , " Anderson wrote .
" Don’t take it for granted because one day they might not be around anymore to say it . "
