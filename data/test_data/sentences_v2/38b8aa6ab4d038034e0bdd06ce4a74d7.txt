3 people hospitalized following Dorchester shooting
It was supposed to be a festive occasion .

Roughly 40 people had gathered for a barbecue in Dorchester , some traveling from outside of Boston to celebrate a mother ’s 50th birthday shortly before midnight on Saturday .
Her family was preparing to run a slide show on a large screen in a small yard in the courtyard of her Franklin Field apartment on Westview and Stratton streets .
It was one of three barbecues in the courtyard that night .

But then , residents said , 14 shots rang out and four people were injured .
One , a guest in her 20s , was shot in the back .
The three others were not attending that barbecue .

One man and two women , with injuries ranging from “ not so severe ” to “ critical , ” were taken to the Boston Medical Center , the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , and Brigham and Women ’s Hospital , according to Boston Emergency Services Lieutenant Gretchen Fox .
The fourth person refused treatment , Fox said .
The ages of the victims were unavailable .
The call concerning the shooting came in at 11:45 p.m. , according to police .

Although the violence was the latest in a week that included a fatal shooting on Dudley Terrace around midnight Friday and a stabbing in East Boston on Wednesday that left a man dead , Boston police spokesman Michael McCarthy said this has been “ one of the safest summers on record .
The fatal shooting marked the 22nd homicide in Boston , a figure that matches the number of homicides for the same period last year , McCarthy said .

The commissioner has always said , one [ shooting ] is too many , ” McCarthy said Sunday .
Considering where other major cities are , we’re experiencing some pretty low numbers .

 McCarthy said the number of shootings citywide is down 25 percent and violent crime is down 6 percent compared to this time last year .

But the recent violence , he said , is still worrisome .

It is concerning anytime there is a shooting , ” McCarthy said , “ We want to find out what happened .
”
 McCarthy said the weekend shootings were not random and it is too early to say whether they were gang - related .
Police said they have made no arrests .

In the shooting that left a 36-year - old man dead and a 31-year - old woman critically injured late Friday on Dudley Terrace , police say they are looking for a black man in a blue hoodie who ran from Dudley Terrace .

Nearly 24 hours later , residents at the Franklin Field apartments say , they were trying to enjoy the summer night when gunfire erupted .

People scattered throughout the courtyard , darting into homes .
Inside apartments , parents and children crashed to the floor for cover .

“ I threw myself to the floor , ” said a 62-year - old resident , who was caring for several children inside her apartment at the time and declined to be named .
Bullets struck the outside of her apartment , leaving holes in the red brick .

I was so afraid it would go through the window , ” she said .

A 43-year - old mother of three , who also declined to give her name , said the incident was especially traumatic for her 8-year - old son , who has autism .
He stood in their apartment with his hands covering his ears as gunfire crackled throughout the complex .

After it was over , the woman said , she saw four men fleeing , including one with a long gun .

There ’s nothing we can do about it , ” said Mercy Hutchinson , 34 , a resident and mother of a 14-year - old boy and a 9 year - old girl , of the violence .
When we are here , sometimes we are scared to come outside . . .
.
I’m afraid something is going to happen .
At the barbecue birthday celebration , the hosts apologized to their guests for the violence .

This is how [ my mother ] will remember her 50th birthday , ” said a 27-year - old woman .
“ We were supposed to be having a good time .
She said she saw the sparks coming from the guns , but could not see the shooters .

It was very cowardly and disrespectful , ” said a 33-year - old resident who attended the birthday celebration but declined to be named for fear of her safety .
It makes me so mad .
In the East Boston killing , Darius Barry , 18 , was arrested Friday in connection with the death of Gage Smith , 23 .
He is expected to be arraigned in East Boston Court Monday .

The safety and security of all Boston residents is our top priority , and we will continue to work diligently to bring peace to all parts of the city , ” Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a statement Sunday .
This weekend ’s shootings are still under investigation and we encourage anyone with information to contact the Boston Police Department . ”
