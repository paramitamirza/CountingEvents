LAFD battles emergency structure fire in Northridge , Calif.
At 3:51 p.m. , EMPTY 28 Companies of Los Angeles firefighters , nine LAFD rescue ambulances , two arson units , one urban search and rescue unit , one rehab/air tender unit , one emergency air unit , one hazardous materials task force , one LAFD helicopter , three EMS battalion captains , five battalion chief officer command teams , and one division chief officer command team , all under the direction of Assistant Chief Roderick Garcia responded to a major emergency structure fire at 19414 Londelius Street in Northridge .

Firefighters arrived quickly during a period of strong north winds to discover heavy smoke and fire showing from a modern one - story 100-by-150 industrial building of concrete tilt - up construction amidst a minimally or unseparated block - long row of similar structures .

A half - dozen workers had safely escaped the involved business , " Ideal 2000 Custom Cabinets , " just prior to firefighters arrival .

Firefighters commenced a fierce initial interior attack on intense fire within the cabinet manufacturing firm , only to be driven back by voluminous flames that fed on volatile contents that filled the structure .

With the subsequent compromise of the lightweight roof , a swift and well - coordinated transition to defensive tactics brought firefighters with handlines to the parapets of the immediately adjacent businesses , while master streams were strategically placed to bring the volume of water necessary to attack the free - burning fire .

Because of the wind and concern for flying embers , an LAFD helicopter with video telemetry and infrared imaging capability was assigned for aerial reconnaissance and command support .

With turbulent winds forcing large volumes of smoke low to the ground , twenty persons from one business immediately to the south were calmly and temporarily evacuated by firefighters to prevent injury .

A total of 187 LAFD personnel tenaciously battled the stubborn flames for one hour and seventeen minutes before confining the wind - swept fire entirely within the occupancy of origin .

No civilian or firefighter injuries were reported .

Fire damage has been estimated at $ 1,000,000 ( $ 500,000 structure & $ 500,000 contents ) .
The cause of this late afternoon blaze was categorized as electrical .
