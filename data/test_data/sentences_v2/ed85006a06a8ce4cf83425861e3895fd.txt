 Residents say police response too slow 4 injured during shooting in Old West End Saturday
 THE BLADE/JEREMY WADSWORTH Enlarge | Buy This Photo Alex and Susan Craig talk about a shooting that occurred over the weekend on Scottwood Avenue in Toledo 's Old West End .
They are unsettled by the shooting , but they will not move after 46 years there .

There was one shot — pop — and everyone dropped to the floor .

Jamil Bolden fell on top of a group of women , trying to protect them from any more gunfire .

One young woman near him had a bloody cheek — she must have been hit , he reasoned .

It was n't until he got home , and his girlfriend saw blood on his shirt , that Mr. Bolden , 18 , realized he also was shot .

The teen was one of four people shot Saturday night at the “ Mansion Party , ” as it was promoted on social media , in Toledo 's Old West End neighborhood .
An estimated 200 people were at the party in a red - brick , corner - lot mansion at 2272 Scottwood Ave .

The music was loud , the girls were pretty , and initially , the atmosphere was fun .

About an hour into the party , at 10:26 p.m. , Rebecca Boone called the Toledo police nonemergency phone line to report an underage - drinking party at the house .

“ The house was full , ” said Ms. Boone , a 10-year Old West End resident .
There were kids everywhere .
We know the neighborhood , and we know that 's not right .
At 10:51 p.m. , another caller made a noise complaint .
About 20 minutes later , more calls — now for a fight .
 “
Everything started around 11 , it started getting rowdy , ” said Mr. Bolden , who was treated at Toledo Hospital for a graze wound to the left side of his abdomen .
You could feel the tension .
You could feel in the atmosphere something was going to happen .
Before we could leave , that 's when everything started going crazy . ”

Mr. Bolden said a group of people got into a fight and ran outside , possibly to retrieve guns .

About this time , a security officer from Signal 88 , a private security company that patrols the Old West End , was at the scene , waiting for police to arrive .

At 11:16 p.m. , “
shots - fired ” calls started coming in to Toledo police .

My officer actually heard the shots , and that 's when he heard a bunch of people screaming , and they all started to pour into the street , ” said Ian Scherer , a Signal 88 shift supervisor .
He pointed women who were screaming for help toward his vehicle for cover . ”

Two minutes later , at 11:18 , police were dispatched .
The first crews arrived four minutes later .

“ I look out the window and it looked like a swarm of kids , ” said neighbor Susan Craig , who has lived in her home , with her husband Alex , for 46 years .
Kids were running left and right , helter - skelter .
As people were leaving the party , piling into cars , more shots were fired .

Mr. Scherer , who showed up at the Scottwood home after the shooting , said people in cars were shooting at other people in cars , continuing to fire as they sped off .

A total of four people , including Mr. Bolden , were wounded in the shooting .
Treated for “ minor injuries ” were Ronald Smith , 22 , Taylor McCormick , 19 , and Sidresha Lamb , 17 , all of Toledo .

“ I 'll call it hell , ” Mr. Bolden said .
" A bullet ai n't got no name .
They 'll come at anybody .
Ms. Boone and other Old West End residents , who sounded off on social media , said police should have responded sooner .

I definitely think they dropped the ball , ” Ms. Boone said .
“ They just did n't take action quick enough .
I know we 're short on cops … but they already knew it was a problem house .
Police Sgt .
Joe Heffernan said that , on busy nights — like weekends , when 911-call volume often increases — “ we have to prioritize our calls by level of importance .
The initial call … had not been dispatched because of higher priority calls , ” the sergeant said .

About three weeks earlier , police and Signal 88 were sent to the house to break up another party , Mr. Scherer said .

The Scottwood house 's wrap - around porch was littered Monday afternoon with broken glass .
A tipped - over city garbage can lay on the ground with at least one empty liquor bottle inside .
A man who answered the door declined to comment .

To have something of this nature happen here is unsettling , ” said Mr. Craig .
But we 're not about to move . ”
