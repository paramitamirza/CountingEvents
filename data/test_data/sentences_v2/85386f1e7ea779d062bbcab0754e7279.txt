Birmingham PD : Juvenile accidentally shot in Ensley Posted : Thursday , July 30 , 2015 6:02 PM EDT Updated : Thursday , August 6 , 2015 6:02 PM EDT
 Birmingham police are investigating after a juvenile was shot in the 5000 block of Avenue N in Ensley .

The preliminary investigation shows the shooting was accidental , Lt .
Theophilus Smith with the Birmingham Police Department said .

The 13-year - old victim , whose name has not been released , was transported to the hospital and underwent surgery .
Police say his injuries may be life - threatening .

Investigators are interviewing witnesses and are questioning four people about the shooting .

One man , who owns a body shop just across the street , said his workers were some of the first to be alerted about what happened .

" We had a young child come to our shop and say that there had been an accident in their home of a shooting .
So one of my workers called 911 and dispatched police over here at the home here .
It 's a family of 6 .
There all good children , all good children .
I think it 's a tragedy that happened here , " David Ortiz said .

The police department released the following statement about the shooting on Thursday night :
 "
This accidental shooting incident involving the juvenile is unfortunate , but preventable .
The BPD would like to ask that all of our citizens be in the mindset that firearms are inherently dangerous and must always be stored carefully and handled with care .
Handlers are taught to treat firearms with respect for their destructive capabilities , and strongly discouraged from playing or toying with firearms which is a common cause of accidents .
The rules of gun safety follow from this mindset . "
