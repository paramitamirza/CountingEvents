2-Year - Old In Critical Condition
After Authorities Say A Gun Shot Itself
NEWLINE Posted by Christian Drake on 05 Jan 2016
 Yet another example of how guns do not kill people happened today when a 2-year - old boy shot himself with a gun he found in the front of his grandfather ’s truck .

The boy ’s family said that he was riding with his grandfather in the truck when the man parked in the driveway to stop briefly inside the boy ’s house .
He left the child in the backseat playing with tools .

Fifteen seconds later the boy had acquired the .32 caliber Kel - Tec gun out of the driver ’s side door pocket , removed it from its holster , and promptly shot himself in the face .

Authorities said that they were not sure if the gun went off on its own .

If the gun went off on its own , maybe guns DO kill people .
However , I seriously doubt that the boy would have shot himself while not holding a gun .

The child inexplicably did not harm himself with the tools he was playing with in the back of the truck .
According to gun nuts , tools like hammers kill people more often than guns do in America .
So…. why did the child have to go for the gun again ?

The boy ’s family told the local news that he was talking and trying to comfort his family while waiting patiently for the ambulance to arrive .
Are you kidding me ?
A 2-year - old shot himself in the face and they are saying the kid was trying to comfort them ?

The county sheriff ’s office has declined to say if charges would be forthcoming while the investigation is ongoing .

What the hell is there to investigate ?
!
There isn’t a conspiracy of ninjas hidden in the glove box of this guy ’s truck waiting to use guns he lets carelessly in his vehicle to shoot 2-year - olds that are also in the truck by coincidence .

Authorities apparently call this an accident , because the adult had no control over whether or not he left his own loaded gun in the truck with a toddler .

# BREAKING :
Officials told me seconds ago that all evidence is pointing towards an accidental shooting .
