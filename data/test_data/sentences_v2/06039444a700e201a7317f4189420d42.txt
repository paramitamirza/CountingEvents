A man , 29 , is facing charged for allegedly accidentally shooting a 7-year - old boy while drunk .

Jeffery Eckstein is charged with second - degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon .

The boy was injured after a gun accidentally discharged in a south St. Louis apartment Tuesday night , according to police .

The 7-year - old was asleep on the couch in a second floor apartment on South Grand .

Police say Eckstein suspect in the case lived downstairs .
He had a gun .
It went off and the bullet went through the floor of the upstairs apartment .

The boy and his 9-year - old brother were sleeping on this couch when the shot rang out .
The bullet came through the floor and the couch cushion and struck the boy in the hip .

I said that was a gunshot , ” Brenda Shepard - Bennett said .
“ Could n't believe it , but I knew what it was .
”
 Shepard - Bennett lives in the apartment and says the boy who was shot is the younger brother of her daughter 's boyfriend .
She says the bullet shattered his hip .

He woke up howling , ‘
Ah… Ah,’ and I said he been shot , ” Shpeard - Bennett said .
Y'all think he fell , he did n't ' fall that was a gunshot .
”
 Shepard - Bennett says the suspect in the case had only moved in downstairs last week .
The building owner says he had told her that he was a vet who needed a place to stay .

But there were some red flags and Nancy Kreis says a family member was already starting to check into the suspect 's background .

“ I do know he misrepresented some things about his service in the army , ” Kreis said .
He said he was a vet , a ranger and deployed four times , do n't know if any of that 's true , do n't think it is .
”

If he is under the influence , what is the difference between him operating a vehicle and operating a gun , ”
Kreis said .
You should n't even have a gun in your presence if you know you under the influence and you might make a mistake , there 's people up there , could be me or my husband and it happened to be a little boy .
”

She says that the boy who was shot will have to have extensive surgery and could be in a wheelchair for up to two months .

The boy was conscious and breathing when he was taken to a hospital .
He was listed in stable condition Wednesday morning .
