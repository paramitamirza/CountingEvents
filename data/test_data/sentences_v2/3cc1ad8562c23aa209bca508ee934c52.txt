" This is LAPD airship requesting resources for a structure fire in two , 1 story commercials , 25 foot by 150 foot , with fire showing through the roof . "
Can you feel the palms getting all sweaty , muscles tightening and adrenaline starting to get the old heart pumping ?

The only exposure was a one story , Type IV metal clad building used for storage , that suffered smoke and heat damage to its contents .
