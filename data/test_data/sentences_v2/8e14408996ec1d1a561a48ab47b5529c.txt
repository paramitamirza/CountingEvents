 A Mundelein man shot to death early Sunday when gunfire erupted near the University of Illinois campus in Champaign was an innocent bystander , authorities say .

George Korchev , 22 , was one of five people to suffer gunshot wounds in separate , but possibly related , shootings stemming from an altercation at an off - campus party .

Authorities say Korchev was walking in the area when the shooting occurred and not involved in the altercation that proceeded it .
Police were searching for suspects , but as of Sunday night no one was in custody .

Korchev was pursuing a career in medicine .
Friend Justin Konieczny described him as an “ all - around amazing guy ” who cared deeply about his family , school and work .

Korchev “ was always smiling and laughing and making sure everyone around him was as well , ”
Konieczny said .
“ Mundelein will miss George for a long time .
”

A man who answered the door at the Korchev family home in Mundelein declined to comment Sunday .

Having recently passed his nursing board exam , Korchev was expected to start a new position Monday as a registered nurse at Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville , according to a statement from hospital President Dominica Tallarico .
