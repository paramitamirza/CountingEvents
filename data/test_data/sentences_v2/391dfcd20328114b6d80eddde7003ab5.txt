The homicide is the fourth club - related of the year and 16th overall , according to police .
Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said , in his 20 years as mayor , he has never seen such a high percentage of club - related homicides .

He called on the state legislature Saturday afternoon at a press conference to adopt wide reforms to target the violence seen in and around nightclubs across cities .
 “
It ’s curious to me in this state we stand on our high horse and say ‘ jeez’ ; after Sandy Hook we should be banning all these assault weapons and such , true enough , ”
DeStefano said .
“
But it seems to me , after these kinds of incidents , you know look in the mirror in Connecticut and take action to save lives .
”
 Gov. Dannel Malloy was also on hand for the press conference Saturday afternoon .
He expressed his condolences to the victims’ families and said he will work with DeStefano and the legislature on some of the proposals .
 “
As a former mayor myself for 14 years , I absolutely agree with almost everything the mayor has said , ” Malloy said .

DeStefano made a wide range of proposals that are likely to draw the ire of many liquor establishments across the state .

He proposed the following measures , many of which would have to be adopted by the state legislature :
 — Ability for cities to levy fees for nightclubs in a district where heavy police presence is required .
 —
Mandate that private security at nightclubs be licensed and trained by the Police Department .

— Ability for city to sign off on licenses for clubs .

— Review “ mosaic ” of different liquor licenses and see whether or not state should simplify them .

DeStefano ’s term as mayor will be up before the start of next year ’s state legislative session .
He said it would be common sense for his successor to push for the same proposals , as well .

A New Haven officer was outside of the club at the corner of Hamilton Street around 3:30 a.m. when he heard gunfire coming from inside .

Police spokesman Officer David Hartman said an officer rushed into the club this morning as more than a hundred patrons rushed out the main doorway .
Several other officers within the block arrived on scene within seconds .

Six gunshot victims were located within the club ’s after - hours area , and Hartman said all available officers , along with firefighters and EMTs from the New Haven Fire Department , were dispatched .
Ambulances were summoned to take the victims to area hospitals .

Hartman said that detectives had begun their investigation and had been interviewing several witnesses .
No suspects had been identified , and police were asking anyone with information about this crime to call the Detective Bureau at 203 - 946 - 6304 .
Hartman said calls may be made anonymously .

Police said that they were told the owners of the club , John Bertini and Peter Forchetti , were not on the property during the shootings .
Hartman said that the Key Club is an adult entertainment venue , and the area of the club that was open to the public has a “ bring - your - own - alcohol ” policy .
The interior was littered with drug paraphernalia and drug packaging , and smelled of marijuana , police said .

The Key Club Cabaret ’s website says it is Connecticut ’s largest after - hours club Friday and Saturday , and Connecticut ’s hottest club .
The club ’s
Twitter said it was offering happy hour all day Friday , and invited people to stop in .

Call Rich Scinto at 203 - 789 - 5748 .
