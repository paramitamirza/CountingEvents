He was taken to a hospital , where he was listed in stable condition .

" Kids playing around guns -- that 's irresponsible to have a gun in the vehicle or wherever the gun was located .
It 's just irresponsible as a parent or the guardian that was around at the time , " resident Ashley Marshall said .

Police have not said if the child was being watched by a parent or guardian at the time of the shooting .

" You have to be responsible .
These are your kids .
These are your babies so to hear something like that ,
no , that 's not cool , " resident Dominique Chappell said .

Others pointed out the alley where the shooting happened was known for illegal activity and that a child should n't have been there in the first place .

" It 's crazy , though , because you should n't have kids back there anyways with the way it looks anyways back there , so , " Chappell said .

There are still a lot of unanswered questions in the case .
Police responded to 11 News though email saying , " There are no new updates on this incident at this time .
Western district detectives are actively investigating the self - inflicted shooting . "

" When I see it , it 's like , ' What the hell are you 'll doing ? '
This ( is not ) supposed to happen , none of this the way it looks .
