 Detectives have identified two men who they say opened fire on a block party filled with family members and children with a shotgun last Saturday .

Kyleif Harley and Dominic Lamar , both 23 , are wanted for the drive - by shooting on the 4100 block of Ogden Street in West Philadelphia on June 20 , Lt .
John Walker said .

It was around 9 p.m. that night when the men drove to the street and opened fire at least once with the shotgun and then fired several times with a handgun , police said .

The gunfire injured 11 people , eight from the same family , with the youngest victim being a 1-year - old girl .
Two boys , an 11- and 12-year - old , were also struck .
Police discovered the 11th victim over the course of their investigation .

" It 's a blessing though that they made it , seriously , " Tyrone Jones , who helped organize the party , told NBC10 this week .

The victims have all been released from the hospital , but some are continuing to be treated because they have shotgun pellets embedded in their bodies that can not be removed without inflicting more damage , according to the lieutenant .

Walker said Harley and Lamar were looking for a person in that area and appeared to open fire randomly .
Both have a criminal background and will face several charges when arrested including attempted murder and aggravated assault .

Anyone with information is asked to call Philadelphia Police 's tip line at 215.686.TIPS.
