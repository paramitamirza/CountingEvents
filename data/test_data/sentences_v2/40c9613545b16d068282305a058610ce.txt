Man shoots 3-year - old inside car - WSMV Channel 4
A man shot a 3-year - old after being in an altercation with a woman he was flirting with Sunday night .

According to Memphis Police Department , a woman was approached as she sat in her car with a child and another woman in the 1400 block of Dewees Drive .
When she told the man she was not interested in him , he started firing into the car .

A 3-year - old who was in the car was shot and remains in extremely critical condition .

" I 'm just praying for her , ” Cardarius Benton said .
“
As crazy as it seems , that ’s how it is now .
”

“ I feel like that is very sad and pitiful , ” Takerehara Smith said .

Smith said she worried about the safety of her mom and other relatives who live in the area , but she simply couldn’t believe an innocent toddler was shot .
 “
Police or security guards should be over here 24/7 , because there is no reason why a 3-year - old should have been able to get shot .
Where is the protection over here ?
"
Smith asked .
 "
A lot of people do n't have importance of life anymore , ”
Benton said .
“ They do n't have any reason to live .
They ai n't got nothing going . "

Benton said he is a rapper whose latest song is called , “
Put the Guns Down .
”
The song is directed at people like this shooter .
Benton hopes people realize there are better ways to deal with anger than pulling a trigger .

" All we can do it just pray and stay out the way , ” he said .

No arrests have been made .
