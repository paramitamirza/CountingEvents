5 injured in NW Atlanta shootout - WTOC - TV : Savannah , Beaufort , SC , News , Weather & Sports
Five people were injured Saturday afternoon in what neighbors described as a shootout in northwest Atlanta .

CBS46 was first on the scene .

Authorities responded to the 2900 block of Delmar Lane after security at the location asked police for help with the shooting , according to a spokesperson with Atlanta police .

Five people were shot and two of the victims fled the scene .

" We have found shell casings in an isolated location here on scene , but it 's hard to say whether these individuals were shooting at each other , whether they were fired upon .
Still in the very early stages of the investigation , " said Officer Ralph Woolfolk with Atlanta police .

All five victims were eventually taken to the hospital with one person in critical condition , according to police .

A spokesperson with Atlanta police said late Saturday that one of the victims was treated and released from the hospital .

Police said at least 50 bullets were fired .
Neighbors told CBS46 's Dontaye Carter that they rushed to make sure their children were on the ground when the shooting started .

" I 'm just glad me or my kids were n't one of those statistics .
Like I said , it 's dangerous and its kids getting shot , you know kids killing kids and it 's should n't even be like that , " said a woman who asked to be called Chyna .

The victims are expected to make a full recovery .

No one is in custody at this time .
