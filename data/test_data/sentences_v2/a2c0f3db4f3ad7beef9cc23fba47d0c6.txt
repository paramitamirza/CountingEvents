Playground party ends with gunfire
NEW ORLEANS -- Four women were injured at a party Sunday evening in the Lower Ninth Ward .
The weekly party at a playground was interrupted by gunfire .

In an area that still bears the scars of Hurricane Katrina , with rebuilt homes mixed with many empty lots , someone opened fire Sunday night at or near a crowded gathering .
One neighbor who did not want to be identified heard multiple gunshots .

" I 'd say at least 10 or 12 .
They were shooting automatic I know . "

It is unclear if the shooting started at the big , weekly Sunday night party at the playground on Caffin Avenue , or if it started blocks away on Choctaw and Florida , then continued for blocks .
New Orleans police are not saying .

But four women in their 20s and 30s who were at the big party were hit on the basketball court and each were driven to hospitals in private cars .
Police say the bullets did not cause life - threatening wounds .

Still , neighbors are scared .

" ' Oh Lord , ' I cried at the beginning because I have grandchildren out there playing .
I said , ' Hush up .
Come inside . '
I said , ' Now . '
They come on running in I say , ' Stay in , " ' said another resident who did not want to be identified .

Other neighbors we spoke with were in fear of going on camera at all .
Some say the music was so loud they could n't hear the gunshots and others say that after the gunshots , they saw all the cars in the area screeching away very fast .

" It looked like it started down there around the corner , and they come down through there shooting look like they shooting , shooting , shooting , all the way down to the street there , " said one unidentified person pointing to Choctaw Street toward Florida Avenue..
