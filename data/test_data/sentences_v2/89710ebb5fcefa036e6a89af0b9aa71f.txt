A 6-year - old girl playing in front of her house was critically wounded when gunfire erupted Tuesday night in the city 's East Germantown section , police said .

Police on Wednesday said the gunman was believed to have been firing at another man on the street , though investigators were continuing to sort out precisely what happened and search for the shooter .

Just before 7 p.m. Tuesday , police were called to the 6300 block of Woodstock Street , where they found the girl on the sidewalk next to the steps of her home , said Chief Inspector Scott Small .

The girl , who had been sitting on her home 's front steps with a family member , was shot in the chest under her left arm and was unresponsive , police said .

Police rushed her to Einstein Medical Center .
She was later transferred to St. Christopher 's Hospital for Children .

Don Tucker , who lives on the block , said he was inside when he heard gunshots .
He rushed outside to check on his 8-year - old daughter .

That 's when the 51-year - old saw the 6-year - old victim motionless in a pool of blood .

" I just went down there to comfort her , keep her calm , " until help arrived , Tucker said .

" She was conscious .
She just said , ' Somebody shot me . ' "

Police arrived and took the girl and a distraught woman to the hospital , Tucker said .

His daughter was safe , but he was still shaken .

" It 's not just about my daughter .
It 's about all the kids , " he said .

Investigators found 21 shell casings from two firearms at the corner of Woodstock and Chelten Avenue , Small said .

The casings were grouped closely together , possibly indicating two guns were being fired in the same direction down Woodstock , Small said .

Police said Wednesday that investigators believed the shooter was firing at another unknown man who was running south on Woodstock Street .
The gunman fled west on Chelten Avenue after the shooting .

Police were checking nearby surveillance cameras for video that may have recorded what happened .

There was no evidence that immediately pointed to a motive for the gunfire or the identity of the shooter , Small said .

Neighbors on Wednesday were speculating about what might have happened .
