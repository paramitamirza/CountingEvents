Charges link man 's gun to 7-year - old boy 's July Fourth killing , 2nd shooting
Responding to an afternoon call of a person with a gun on the West Side , Chicago police officers chased after Demond Coffee when he took off running last Aug. 17 , according to police .

As the foot pursuit passed an elementary school in the 3900 block of West Wilcox Street , officers spotted Coffee remove a handgun from his waistband and toss it aside , according to an arrest report .
The Glock was loaded with 15 live rounds , including one in the chamber , authorities said .

The gun was just one of hundreds confiscated by Chicago police during arrests every year , many in the gang - infested West Garfield Park community where police said Coffee , a reputed member of the Four Corner Hustlers , sold drugs .

But this blue steel semi - automatic already had carved a swath of violence on Chicago 's streets , the Tribune has learned .

As Coffee appeared last week at the Leighton Criminal Court Building on state weapons charges , federal agents arrested him on new charges linking his gun to one of Chicago 's most memorable killings of 2015 — the Fourth of July slaying of 7-year - old Amari Brown .

Prosecutors alleged in federal court that the weapon had been used in another shooting that left a 15-year - old boy wounded just five weeks later .

While Coffee has not been accused in either shooting , prosecutors argued during a detention hearing Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Cole that he should remain locked up as a danger to the community .
Noting that the two shootings took place just weeks from Coffee 's arrest , they said it was likely he had been in contact with those responsible for both crimes .

Cole ordered Coffee held without bail , records show .

A federal indictment unsealed last week charged Coffee with being a felon in possession of a handgun , which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison and a $ 250,000 fine .

Coffee 's attorney , Jennifer Blagg , told the Tribune on Friday that the gunman in Amari 's killing already had been charged and there was no allegation that Coffee had any involvement in the crime .
Blagg said she may ask the judge to reconsider setting a bond as the case moves forward .

" I feel confident that when the facts of the case come out , they will show that my client is n't the type of person the federal government is portraying him to be , " Blagg said .

Amari was shot and killed just before midnight on the Fourth of July in the 1100 block of North Harding Avenue in the Humboldt Park neighborhood .
He was one of three people killed and 27 wounded over an eight - hour stretch that night .

Police said the boy had been at his grandmother 's house earlier in the day before spending time at his father 's relatives ' home on Harding at night .
The 7-year - old was outside the home watching fireworks with a 26-year - old woman , his father and others when shots rang out .

The woman , Malerie Britton , later told the Tribune she had just talked to Amari , who was the son of a childhood friend , moments before the shots rang out .
She said she 'd told the soon - to - be second - grader he was getting big .

" That 's because my birthday is coming up so fast , " she said Amari told her .
In the next moment , Britton felt a deep pain in her chest — like a hard punch — and fell backward into a fence .
A gunshot had cut into her , passing through her breast .

" Somebody is shooting ! " came a cry .

As people carried her into a nearby yard , Britton could see Amari lying on his back , bleeding on the sidewalk , his eyes open .
He had been struck in the chest and died on the way to the hospital .

The day after the shooting , then - Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy publicly chided Amari 's father , Antonio Brown , alleging that he was the target and his gang ties were what led to his son 's slaying .
The father had been arrested dozens of times and was also a reputed member of the Four Corner Hustlers .

On July 22 , police arrested Rasheed Martin , 20 , at a home in Superior , Wis. , about 460 miles northwest of Chicago , and charged him with first - degree murder in Amari 's killing , records show .
Police said Martin may have been involved in an earlier dispute with the boy 's father .
After his arrest , Martin gave a video - recorded statement to Chicago detectives implicating himself and a second man in the killing , authorities said .

" He admitted , among other things , that he was armed with a gun and that he fired one shot , " a Cook County prosecutor said during a bond hearing in July .

Martin is being held without bail in Cook County Jail , records show .
No one else had been charged in Amari 's killing .

On Aug. 7 , just over a week after Martin 's bond court appearance , the Glock pistol used to kill Amari was used to shoot a 15-year - old boy in the 3300 block of West Lexington Street in the Homan Square neighborhood on the West Side , authorities said .
The victim was standing on the sidewalk when a dark - colored sedan passed and someone inside shot him in the abdomen , arm and hip , police said .
A friend took him to Mount Sinai Hospital , where his condition was stabilized .

Court records show no one has been charged in that shooting .

On Aug. 17 , Coffee was standing with another man , Demontre Enos , by Genevieve Melody Elementary School on West Wilcox Street when officers approached them about 1:30 p.m. because Enos matched a description from a call of a person with a gun , according to the police arrest report .

The men took off running in different directions , with Enos leading police east on Monroe Street past children playing on the sidewalk and residents who were tending to their lawns , " causing them to move quickly out of the way to avoid injuries , " according to the report .
Enos was charged with misdemeanor reckless conduct and later convicted , reports show
 Coffee , meanwhile , threw the gun as he fled down Wilcox , police said .
He was arrested , but as officers were leading him into the Harrison District station , he " used his feet to push off the door " and broke free , leading to a brief foot chase , according to the report .

After he was again apprehended , Coffee was searched and police found more than $ 1,900 on him , all in small bills .
A drug - sniffing dog detected the " scent of narcotics " on the money , the report stated .

When police inventoried the Glock , a trace of the serial number revealed it had been reported stolen last April 21 from Indianapolis , the arrest report stated .
Indianapolis police could not provide further details on Friday .

Court records show Coffee has a long rap sheet , including weapons offenses but no history of violent crimes .
In 2011 , he was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon and given probation , records show .
That was followed by convictions for fleeing and eluding police and unlawfully possessing a handgun by a felon , netting him a sentence of three years in prison , authorities said .
