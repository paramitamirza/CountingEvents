NOPD : Gunman opens fire near group of children , hitting one - KSLA News 12 Shreveport , Louisiana News Weather & Sports
New Orleans police are investigating a shooting in the Leonidas neighborhood that left an 8-year - old boy injured .

The incident occurred Wednesday around 5:30 p.m. in the 1400 block of Monroe Street .

Witness said the shooter was in a red car driving down Monroe when he opened fire on a home near the corner of Jeannette Street right in front of a group of children - some as young as 5 - hitting the 8-year - old boy in the leg .

Somebody that just do n't have no sense , felt like being the devil , I guess , stuck his arm out that window and just went to shooting at that house where all those kids was out there playing , ” said a witness , who FOX 8 is not identifying .
“ It sounded like - just like eight , seven or eight shots just going off , that little red car just going up Monroe just shooting , and I just broke and ran over there .
”

The witness rushed to help the boy who was bleeding and clearly in pain .

He was just hollering and was just nervous .
He was shaking , did n't know what to do .
None of the kids knew what to do , hurt , they’re hurt , they’re used to playing out here , they’re probably not going to want to play out here no more , ” the witness said .

Neighbors said children are often playing in the area where police spent time Wednesday evening collecting multiple shell casings .
 “
Riding their bikes , riding their little scooters and just playing , that 's all , just playing .
An everyday thing for them .
They 're either on the basketball goal , riding their bike , running up and down , ” the witness said .
And that 's what they get today - nonsense .
”

Now neighbors are worried about the boy who took a bullet and the other children whose lives are now marred by violence .

They do n't even think of what they 're doing to the neighborhood .
I 'm pretty sure they know we got to live around here , they probably come from somewhere else and they 're not even thinking about our kids , ”
the witness said .

The investigation into the incident in ongoing .
