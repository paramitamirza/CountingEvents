OGDEN â€”
A 13-year - old girl was accidentally shot in the neck by her 11-year - old sister Sunday after the girls found a gun in their grandparents ' bedroom while cleaning .

The girl , however , did not suffer any life threatening injuries .
Ogden Police Lt .
Jake Sube said she was very lucky .

" It absolutely could have been very tragic , " he said .

The incident happened just after 3 p.m. while the girls were at their grandparents ' home in the 100 North block of Pingree Ave .

" It appears that the two girls were alone cleaning the grandparents ' bedroom when the gun was found .
Moments after finding the gun , the 11-year - old accidentally discharged the firearm striking the 13-year - old in the neck , " he said .

Sube did not know Sunday where in the bedroom the gun was found .
The older girl actually told her sister to be careful after she found the weapon because it might be loaded , he said .

" About the same moment it was fired , " Sube said .

The weapon used was described as an older model .22-caliber revolver , Sube said .
Police believe the elderly grandparents had not used the gun for many years and likely forgot it was in the bedroom .

" It had been out of sight , out of mind for a long time , " Sube said .

He said the bullet broke her skin but did not penetrate any vital organs .
He said a lump in her skin where the bullet came to rest could be seen .

" When police first made contact with the victim , she was conscious and alert but obviously shaken up .
She was taken to a local hospital in good spirits and will likely have surgery to remove the bullet , " Sube said .
" She had a very positive attitude . "

No arrests were made or citations issued Sunday .
The investigation would continue , he said .

" The family involved has avoided a tragedy today and we are very thankful .
This could have been much worse , " said Sube who also said the incident was a good reminder for all gun owners to keep their weapons secured in their homes , even if they do n't have children of their own .
