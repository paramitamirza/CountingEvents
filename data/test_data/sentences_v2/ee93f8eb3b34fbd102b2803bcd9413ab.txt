EXCLUSIVE :
Mom Distraught After Toddler Shot In South Sacramento
SACRAMENTO ( CBS13 ) —
It ’s a heartbreaking story that ’s shaken up families in South Sacramento—how a 2-year - old girl was shot in the head in South Sacramento .

Aubrey is fighting for her life after the shooting on Monday where investigators were called in with reports the 2-year - old accidentally shot herself in the head .
No gun has been found by investigators .

“
My heart dropped and I found her on the ground with blood … I just picked her up , screamed and ran outside , ” said her mom Annique Davis .

She didn’t want to show her face on camera and says she has post - traumatic stress .
She says she hasn’t been allowed to see Aubrey since she found her lying on the floor in an upstairs bedroom while visiting a friend in South Sacramento on Monday afternoon .

REPORTER :
When you put the baby in that room , did you see a gun ?

ANNIQUE
: I’ve never seen a gun in that room ever .
I never knew there was a gun in the house ; if I did I wouldn’t have put my daughter in that room , period .

She says she was in the kitchen making food .
Her friend Linda was helping , and an older woman named Deborah was in another upstairs bedroom .

REPORTER :
When you went to get your baby , did you see a gun ?

ANNIQUE :
At the moment I didn’t look to see a gun .
I just thought to pick my daughter up and I didn’t see anything but blood all over the place .

But questions remain .
The gun has never surfaced , raising red flags for the Sacramento County Sheriff ’s Department and Aubrey ’s father , DeAngelo Mansion .

“ Somebody ’s not telling the truth and my daughter is here fighting for her life , and I’m feeling the same pain she is , ” he said .

Mansion is no longer in a relationship with Davis , but he ’s angry and frustrated , feeling someone is covering up what really happened .

“ Where is the gun ?
” he said .
“ Why is the gun missing ?
If my daughter was able to pick it up then where is it ?
”

The sheriff ’s department says there were two 911 calls made that day .
One was by Davis who told the dispatcher her baby was shot .
The other was by someone else in the home who said the baby shot herself .

“ I’m
angry I’m lost I don’t know what to think , just seeing my daughter like that is tearing me up and I’m trying to stay strong for her , ” he said .

Two parents are searching for answers while their little girl fights to stay alive .

“ I want to know if someone shot her and if someone did why ? ” Davis said .
“
And if she shot herself , why someone would hide a gun ?

Mansion says he hasn’t been able to reach Davis , and says her neglect is not surprising .

Davis , clearly torn up , says she hasn’t spoken to the other two women in the house since the incident , and has her own questions .
