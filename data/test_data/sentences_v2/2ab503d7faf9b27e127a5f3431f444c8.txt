Firefighters arrived quickly to discover intense fire throughout an 150 ' x 100 ' one story ' L - shaped ' metal clad industrial building .
Firefighters briskly deployed handlines and master streams in a clearly defined defensive posture until a decisive offense with handlines was possible against the specter of fallen high - voltage electric lines and stubborn flames .

The fire was confined to the structure of origin and extinguished in less than ninety minutes .

A 21 year - old employee and a 61 year - old contractor within the furniture manufacturing and warehouse facility at the time of the fire , were able to escape unaided prior to Firefighters arrival .

The older man , suffering a minor thermal burn to his right arm , declined LAFD transportation before leaving for medical care via a private vehicle .

The younger male , who sustained an electrical burn to his right hand and lower back was transported by LAFD Paramedics to Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank in fair condition .

One Los Angeles Firefighter was medically evaluated and immediately returned to active fireground duty after having been struck on the helmet by a falling chair .

Loss to the yet identified firm is estimated at $ 2,750,000 ( $ 750,000 structure & $ 2,000,000 contents ) .
The cause of this late afternoon fire remains under active investigation .
