SHARE Fired   worker ’s   award   expands By Amy Hamilton
Tuesday , September 1 , 2015 A former Montrose County employee , who won a settlement following her getting fired after asking to change her schedule while pregnant , has been awarded an additional $ 465,011 by a judge .
In late July , Stephanie Barnett , the former director of the county ’s internal services division , won an award of $ 306,400 , mostly in back pay damages .
Jurors during a weeklong trial determined Montrose County violated the law in firing her when she requested to work part time in May 2013 .
Barnett was fired seven days after meeting with her former boss , Montrose ’s former county manager , Roy “ Rick ” Eckert .
Barnett ’s total award now is $ 771,411 and she and her attorneys plan to seek attorney costs and litigation costs that could reach a total of $ 1 million , said one of her attorneys , Nick Mayle with the law firm Killian , Davis , Richter & Mayle in Grand Junction .
“
I think it ’s a significant award and I think it reflects that the jury and judge found that Ms. Barnett was subject to a lot of discrimination , ” he said .
Mayle said the most recent ruling on Aug. 28 by U.S. District Court Judge James Parker was an award for Barnett ’s front pay , or an estimated amount of income she lost from the end of her trial into the future .
Barnett ’s prior award by a jury of 12 residents was for back pay , or the amount of money she lost from the time of getting fired to the date of trial .
According to the complaint , Eckert told Barnett her division would be dissolved because of “ budgetary restraints ” at the county .
However , she was the only employee to lose her job and Barnett ’s duties were taken over by another person .
Montrose County has said in a statement that they “
consider this case to be completely without merit .
” Montrose County has the option to file an appeal of both monetary awards .
A media representative said Tuesday the county is awaiting judgment in the case and would not comment for a story .
Barnett , who had worked for the county since November 2007 , had an “ exemplary employment record and continuously received positive employment evaluations .
Just a few months before her termination , Barnett was given an award by her peers for her work excellence , ” the complaint states .
Shortly after being fired , Barnett miscarried and lost her baby , the complaint states .
Jurors determined Montrose County violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act in firing Barnett .
