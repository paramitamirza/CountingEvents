 LOUISVILLE , Ky. ( WHAS11 ) â€“ Louisville Metro Police continue to search for the man who walked into a packed west end club early Sunday morning and fired shots into the crowd .
Witnesses said a man , dressed in all white , entered Cole 's Place around 3 a.m. Sunday and started shooting .

Six people were injured in the shooting spree , including a woman who was eight months pregnant .
The woman was forced to give birth early but the mother and her new baby girl are reportedly doing well .

Crystal Teasley was at Cole 's Place this weekend when the gunman burst into the club and started shooting .
Her son , Kendall , was among the six people who sustained gunshot wounds .
Teasley said they were there to celebrate his 21st birthday .

" Everybody was having a good time and right at 3 o'clock shots got fired we all took off running and my son was like , ' I 'm hit ! '
And when we turned around [ Kendall ] was on the ground along with my nephew and three or four other people , " Teasley recalled .
" I kinda feel like it is my fault because if I would n't have had the birthday party , he might not have got hit . "

 Kendall was shot three times .
Teasley said he is connected to a chest tube and has no feeling in his right hand .
She said rehabilitating his hand will be a priority because her son is a basketball player .
The former Valley High School athlete has aspirations of someday playing basketball on a professional level .

Teasley said seeing her son suffer brought back dark memories from February 2005 when her husband , Michael Teasley , was murdered at a nightclub .
The venue , Club 502 , was shut down shortly after the shooting .

" We were doing security at Club 502 and we had put a guy out of the club and he came back and told my husband he was gonna get him , " Teasley said .
" After the club let out we was clearing the lot and he came back and shot him five times . "

Teasley said she is amazed no one was killed in the shooting Sunday morning .
She 's praying the suspect , who remains at large , will soon be apprehended .

" Wherever he 's at he should be sick inside because besides my son and the other people --that lady was pregnant ... that baby was innocent , " Teasley said with her voice full of emotion .
" Whoever did it -- he might not be done . "

Everyone who was shot suffered what are believed to be non - life threatening injuries .
Teasley said her nephew , Deandre Strewsberry , is home from the hospital and is doing well .
She said a bullet went through his leg .
It 's unclear how long her son Kendall will have to be hospitalized .

Anyone with information on this shooting can call the Louisville Metro Police Department tip line , 574-LMPD.
