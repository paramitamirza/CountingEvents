 COTTONWOOD HEIGHTS —
A 17-year - old boy was shot and killed at a party celebrating the end of the school year Wednesday as some teens were passing around a stolen gun .

A group of three teenage boys and two 18-year - old girls were gathered in the basement of a home at 6825 S. Pinerock Drive ( 3300 East ) for the party Wednesday night .

A teenager who lives at the home had secured a revolver stolen during a residential burglary earlier in the week , said Cottonwood Heights Police Lt .
Mark Askerlund .
Investigators did not yet know if the teens at the party were involved in the burglary .

Around 10:30 p.m. , the three boys left the room and the two girls stayed on a couch .

" The boys went to a closet area in the basement and one of them produced a handgun .
They were showing it to each other , passing it around , and fired through several of the rounds , " Askerlund said .

Police believe the boys thought the gun was unloaded .
The initial rounds " cycled through what probably were some empty cylinders until it came into the live round .
That round discharged , striking one of the juveniles , " Askerlund said .

The bullet struck the teen in the head .

Adults at the home called 911 and tried to use live - saving measures , but the teen died at the home .

Police took everyone at the home in for questioning .
Two 16-year - old boys , students at Brighton High School , were arrested and booked into juvenile detention , Cottonwood Heights Police Sgt .
Corbett Ford said .

One teen was arrested for investigation of negligent homicide and the other for investigation of receiving stolen property .

Fellow classmates identified the victim as Harley Jarrett .
He was a junior at Brighton High .

" We were made aware of the incident last night .
Of course we are always saddened to hear of such tragic incidents .
Our thoughts are with the entire community , " said Jeff Haney , Canyons School District spokesman .

Brighton High School
Principal Charisse Hilton said the school 's counseling staff would be available to help students over the next several days .

" Anytime one of our students is hurt or passes away it has a huge impact on the whole school community , " Hilton said .
" We just want students to know if they need somewhere to go , someone to talk to , we know this is really hard on our kids and we want to be there to support them . "

Rene Meyer , who lives near where the shooting occurred , said he was at home at the time of the incident and noticed what looked like the lights of " all the cop cars in the city " filling his street .

" It 's always tragic , of course , and it probably was an accident , " Meyer said .
" It 's always tragic ... and stupid .
It does n't have to happen . "
