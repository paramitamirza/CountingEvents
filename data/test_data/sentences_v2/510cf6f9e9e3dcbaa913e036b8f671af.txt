An 8-year - old child died Sunday morning and her mother remains in the hospital following an accidental shooting inside a home in Paulding County .

The mother and brother of an 8-year - old girl who died from a gunshot wound to the head were arrested in connection to the child 's death .

The Paulding County Sheriff 's Office arrested 23-year - old Quincy Lynch and 45-year - old Marsha Lynch .

Deputies responded to a home in the 400 block of Fairview Drive in reference to an accidental shooting .
When they arrived , they discovered two victims with gunshot wounds .
Marsha Lynch suffered a gunshot wound to the leg .
Sharai Lynch suffered a gunshot wound to the head .
Sharai died while en route to the hospital .

Officers say Marsha told authorities a semi - automatic weapon fell from a table and discharged once it hit the ground .
She further told police that when the gun discharged , it struck her leg first , then traveled into the child 's head .

An autopsy performed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab indicated the bullet entered Sharai 's head first , and then traveled through Marsha 's leg .
Police say this information led them to believe the story about the gun falling off of a table and accidentally discharging is false .

Deputies requested the firearm used in the shooting be analyzed as well .
The GBI crime lab determined the firearm was functioning properly and that it could not have accidentally discharged .

Marsha Lynch has been charged with obstruction .
Quincy Lynch has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct .
Both Marsha and Quincy have bonded out of jail .
