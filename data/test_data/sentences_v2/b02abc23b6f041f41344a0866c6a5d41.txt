A family of five , including three children , was found fatally shot in their Culpeper , Virginia , home in what appears to be a murder - suicide .

The bodies of Clarence and Shauna Washington , both 35 , and their three daughters -- 4-year - old Olivia , 6-year - old Onya and 13-year - old Omesha -- were found inside their home Sunday night .

Family and friends told authorities the couple had been having an ongoing domestic dispute that apparently grew more heated Saturday night .
Authorities did not receive any calls for help from the home .

Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins said the death investigation has been preliminarily classified as a murder - suicide .

" It 's really just sad , it 's depressing for me .
I 've never had any indication there was trouble [ with the family ] , " neighbor Reggie Massie said .

The last known contact with the family was around 5:20 p.m. Saturday .
They did n't attend St. Stephen 's Baptist Church on Sunday , as they usually did .

By Sunday night , their relatives had gotten worried , so Shauna Washington 's mother , Diane Minor , and a cousin went to the family 's home at 14458 Rixeyville Rd .
The home 's front door was bolted and locked , but Minor forced her way in through a small window .

Inside the house , she found the bodies of her daughter , son - in - law and three granddaughters .

Authorities received a call around 10 p.m.

One of Shauna Washington 's cousins , Nicole Minor - Melvin , said Shauna had wanted out of her marriage , but Clarence did n't .
She said she 'd never imagined something like this would happen .
Shauna was more like a sister to her than a cousin .

"
My prayers , my pictures of us , our conversations ; that was my sister , " she said before breaking into tears .
" That 's my heart , my best friend , my world . "

Minor - Melvin described Shauna as an incredibly involved , loving mother who headed up two Girl Scout troops at the Daisy and Cadet levels .
 "
There is a need for grief counseling and support for the girls , for their parents , for the various adult volunteers that Shauna worked with , " Jennifer Pfister with Girl Scouts of Virginia said .

Shauna Washington was born and raised in Culpeper .
For 12 years , she worked as a certified nursing assistant at Culpeper Health and Rehab before transitioning into home health care , all while taking classes online .
Monday would have been her first day selling insurance at AFLAC.
 Shauna 's family members said Clarence Washington had owned four guns , and the couple had growing difficulties , but added that Clarence was not a bad person , and was a good provider .

He worked two jobs : foreman at the Bingham and Taylor Grey Iron Foundry by day , and as a custodian for Sycamore Park Elementary School by night for six years .
All three of his children would have been students at the school in the fall .

" From all accounts , these girls were delightful , " Dr. Bobbi Johnson , superintendent of Culpeper County Public Schools said .
" Good students , lots of friends .
[ Clarence ] was a quiet man , but by all accounts a very good worker and the family as a unit was involved in the school division . "

Shauna 's family members said Clarence did not have a criminal history , but they have no doubt he is responsible for the crime .

The sheriff said a gun was recovered at the scene .

Nathaniel Herr , an assistant professor at American University , said stress can lead to such extreme cases of domestic violence .
 "
[ It 's ]
often the spark that ignites something that 's already there , these vulnerability factors that bring to the table -- genes , early experiences , things they 're taught , and other ongoing concerns in their life , " Herr said .

Herr said family members and friends should be aware of someone who displays a sudden change in mood , becomes more irritable or more prone to argue or fight -- those can often be precursors to even more serious violence .

A prayer vigil will be held at the family 's church , St. Stephen 's Baptist , Wednesday evening .
Friends and family have been leaving flowers and other items outside the home , and neighbors have been sending food to Shauna Washington 's mother .
