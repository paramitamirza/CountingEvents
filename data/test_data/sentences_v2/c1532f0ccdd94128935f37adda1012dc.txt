 — Two children are recovering after neighbors said they were injured Sunday in an apparent drive - by shooting in Henderson .

The Henderson Police Department declined to release any information , including whether or not the community should be concerned for their safety following the incident .
Neighbors and community leaders said they are frustrated by the incident , which happened in broad daylight .

Two neighbors said the children were playing basketball at Owen Davis Park near their home when the incident happened .

“ I heard the shooting .
I was sitting in my living room and I heard about 10 shots , ” said neighbor Debura Alston .
“
Two little innocent boys got shot .
It ’s a shame how easy these guns are to get to .
”

After Alston heard the shots , neighbor Ronald Jackson said he saw one of the shooting victims running away from the park as he looked for help .

“ I looked at one kid and he was shot in the arm , ” Jackson said .

Henderson City Council member Melissa Elliot said the police chief contacted her after the incident and asked her to help find a solution to gun violence in the community .
 “
We’re looking at the Boston cease fire method to do an initiative for people to drop their weapons , ” Elliot said .

Elliot represents the ward where the incident took place and works closely with youth there .
She said the incident has robbed many children of their innocence .

“
They did not want to walk home today .
I took four loads of children back home in my car because they were afraid of getting shot , ” she said .
