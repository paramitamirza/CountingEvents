Bridgeport Police Confident Suspects In Mass Shooting
Will Be Caught
Bridgeport police Chief Armando Perez was confident Monday that detectives would catch the shooters who hid behind bushes outside a house party on Sunday and fired on more than 100 people , wounding 13 .

" Do n't be surprised by the end of the week we have these two guys in custody , " Perez said .
" We are there . "

Since city officers rushed to the chaotic scene early Sunday on Plymouth Street , officials said they have been joined by federal investigators with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .

And it 's federal charges Perez wants the shooters to face .
" Hopefully we will be able to put these people away for a long time , " Perez said , noting he has the support of the U.S. attorney .

" I want to show everyone if you are going to have the guts to do something like this , this is what 's going to happen , " Perez said .

" They had no regard for human life .
Total disregard .
[ They ] just shot into the crowd , " Perez said .

By Monday , the majority of the shooting victims , many of whom were shot in the legs , ha been released from hospitals .
The victims were in their late teens and early 20s .

The most seriously injured , a woman shot in the face , remained in critical but stable condition , city officials said .

" They 're optimistic that she is going to pull through , " city spokesman Av Harris said Monday .

Among the evidence collected were 10 shell casings belonging to .40-caliber and .45-caliber firearms .

" It 's only for the grace of god no one died , " Perez said Monday .
" There should 've been five or six people dead that day . "

The probe into the case continued at a fevered pace Monday with a captain , a lieutenant and 10 detectives working on it , Perez said , not counting the federal agents .

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy spoke to officials in Bridgeport on Monday and pledged the state 's support .
Perez plans to contact Commissioner Dora Schriro of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection on Tuesday .

But support has n't only come from law enforcement .
People in the city have also been helping the investigators tracking down the shooters .
Perez said : " The community is with us . "

The suspects opened fire on people attending a house party Plymouth Street early Sunday .

" People initially thought it was fireworks .
By some witness accounts , even the DJ said , ' Do n't worry about it , it 's fireworks , ' until people started realizing they were shot , " Capt .
Brian Fitzgerald said at an afternoon news conference .

Police have not released the names of the homeowners , who requested a permit to serve alcohol at the event and were denied , officials said .

City officials said they had denied the request because police had been called to the home in the past for loud parties and domestic violence .

Police believe that homeowners were charging for alcohol and said they could face charges .

Police have yet to say what motivated the shooting , but were investigating whether the shooters had attended the party , according to Fitzgerald .

City residents often request permits to hold house parties and serve alcohol , but police turn them down , Perez said .
He noted these parties are opportunities for violence .

" We flatly deny them .
If you want to have a party go rent a hall â€¦ and hire a police officer , " Perez said .
" You are not going to have a party in the back of your house . "

Perez has assigned a lieutenant who will work with officers to seek out unsanctioned parties .

" Any time we encounter these kinds of parties , we are going to shut it down , " Perez said .
" You just can not allow these things .
"
 The Plymouth Street shooting comes just over a year after nine people were shot at the Trumbull Gardens Housing complex .
A 37-year - old Shelton man was killed in the gunfire .
