Teen accused of shooting younger brother says he didn’t think ...
A Snohomish County teenager accused of shooting his 11-year - old brother told police he didn’t believe the gun would fire .

The 15-year - old appeared in court Monday at the Denny Youth Center in Everett on reckless endangerment and unlawful possession of a firearm charges after the shooting that critically injured his brother in Everett Sunday .

He told detectives on Monday that he bought the gun from an acquaintance a few months after he was shot last August .

A .38 caliber revolver was recovered from the scene .

It is still under investigation whether or not the suspect 's parents knew that he was in possession of the weapon .

The 11-year - old managed to call 911 on his own .
He ’s recovering is intensive care where he is now in serious condition .

Though prosecutors did n't get into the details of what happened moments before the shooting , they did say that the sophomore at Mariner High School mishandled the gun while sitting on the doorstep of his home .

“
He clearly did not know how to handle it because he thought the bullet would not fire with the trigger , ”
Snohomish County Deputy Prosecutor Randy Yates said at the hearing .

Prosecutors say the teen admitted he thought the gun may have been stolen when he bought it on the street for $ 250 .

On Sunday , deputies swarmed the Barisa apartment complex near Everett when they thought a gunman was on the run .

Then their attention went to the apartment where the boy lives .
 “
They determined that in fact , no one had fled , that the young boy had been shot by an older brother , ” said Snohomish County Sheriff 's Deputy Lt .
David Bowman .

Prosecutors say the teen has a record of being associated with teens involved with gang violence and was accused of assault but never convicted .

Prosecutors asked the judge for a $ 10,000 bail , but the judge ended up setting a bail of $ 5,000 , with several conditions .

He 'll have to stay in Washington State , live with his parents under house arrest , and have no other law violations .

The teen agreed .

The 16-year - old 's family members were not in court .
