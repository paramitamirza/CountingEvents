A woman identified as the mother of a 4-year - old girl who died after being shot in the head along the 1800 block of N. 20th St. is escorted to a police cruiser on Thursday , June 23 , 2016 .

Philadelphia police Friday charged the mother of a 4-year - old girl who fatally shot herself Thursday with third - degree murder .

Shakeya Holmes , 25 , was also accused of trying to cover up the circumstances that led to daughter Sani 's fatal injury in their North Philadelphia home .

Holmes , who was in police custody , was arraigned on her charges in Municipal Court via a video linkup about 8:30 a.m. Saturday .
She did not show any emotion as she appeared on the video monitor .

Magistrate Jane Rice denied a motion to set bail for Holmes , ordering her kept in custody .

Police are also seeking her boyfriend , Demetrius Williams , on a charge of involuntary manslaughter and related offenses in connection with the case .
They have an arrest warrant out for him .

Authorities received a 911 call about 12:25 p.m. Thursday directing them to a townhouse on 20th Street near Berks .

Lt .
John Stanford , a police spokesman , said Thursday that responding officers found the girl 's mother on the front steps , holding the 4-year - old girl .

Sani was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital , where she was pronounced dead about 1 p.m. of a bullet wound just above one eye .

Police said the shooting happened in a second - floor bedroom , where they found a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol .

The girl found the gun in a closet , police said .

The only other person in the house at the time besides the mother and the 4-year - old was the girl 's 3-year - old sister .

Police on Friday said Sani may have accidentally shot herself .

" It looks like the injuries are self - inflicted , " said Officer Tanya Little , a police spokeswoman .

Acquaintances of the mother have also said that the mother 's boyfriend lived in the home .

The townhouse is in a development called Jackie 's Garden , an affordable - housing community owned by Marlton - based Michaels Development Co.
A spokeswoman for the company said Friday that she could not provide details about residents of the house where the girl was shot .

It was at least the third accidental shooting of a child this year in Philadelphia .

On April 7 , a 9-year - old boy discovered his parents ' loaded and unlocked gun in the bedroom of the family 's Grays Ferry home and accidentally shot himself in a hand .
He was treated for his injuries .

On April 16 in East Kensington , 4-year - old Tahirah Phillips was in a bedroom with her father , Maurice , and her six siblings - ages 13 years to 7 months - when her father , who police said was recklessly playing with his gun , accidentally fired it .

The bullet tore through the girl 's head .
She was pronounced dead at the scene .

Following that shooting , police said , Maurice Phillips , 30 , punched his 5-year - old daughter and wiped Tahirah 's blood on her shirt to make it appear as if the girl had fired the shot that killed her sister .

He fled but was arrested later and charged with third - degree murder , involuntary manslaughter , endangering the welfare of children , and related offenses .
His preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 13 .
