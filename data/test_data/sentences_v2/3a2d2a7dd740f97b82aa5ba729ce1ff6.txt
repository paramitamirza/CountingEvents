Neighbors and friends of a 16-year - old killed Friday say his shooting was an “ unfortunate accident ” -- one that stemmed from a group of teens playing with a gun .

Travon Rollins , an upcoming junior at Rickards High School and football player , was killed when he was shot around 5:35 p.m. Friday evening near his Tess Circle home .
Rollins later died at the hospital .

Tallahassee Police are investigating the shooting as a homicide and continue to interview witnesses and process evidence .

Ke’Ambrielle Sanders went to school with Rollins .

Saturday , she was still shocked by her friend 's death .
As she stood a few doors down from where Rollins – who she called Nugget – was shot , the 17-year - old remembered him as a fun - loving , gregarious teen .

He kept everybody smiling , ” Sanders said .
When someone was down , he would come by you and he would try to cheer you up .
Any way he can he would try to cheer you up . "

She recalled seeing him on the football field as she awaited her turn to dance with the Rickards band during half - time .
That made her happy , but she wished they had become closer .

I just wish I could have talked to him before that happened .
We were close , but I wish we could have gotten closer while he was alive , ” Sanders said .
Everybody has a time when they leave .
I think he did this for a reason .
I think it was his time to go but he ’s in better hands now .
The small neighborhood near the intersection of Blountstown Highway , Tharpe Street and Mission Road was buzzing Friday as first responders arrived on scene .

Neighbors said some of their first thoughts were for Rollins’ family .
Several said his older brother died in January from complications with sickle cell anemia .

Sanders was one of dozens of people who saw Rollins lying on the ground , a pool of blood spreading on his shirt .

Stephen Hardy was trying to help get the teen to the hospital after seeing him get shot .
None of the teens involved were over 18 , Hardy said .

They were kids .
They didn’t know what to do .
They panicked , ”
Hardy said .
They were like ‘
what do we do
, what do we do?’
And I was like ‘ get him to the hospital .
That ’s what you do .
A group of people had trouble loading Rollins into a car to rush him to the hospital before emergency responders arrived .
Hardy said he helped fold the teen ’s legs into the back seat .

The shooting was not gang related and there was no argument or altercation beforehand , he said .

Hardy said his own 16-year - old son and Rollins used to play basketball on a goal that he set up on the street curb .

He said he always saw Rollins upbeat with a smile on his face .
It ’s tragic to see him pass in an instant .

We all knew they all were playing , and they were playing around with a gun , one went off and hit him in the chest , ”
Hardy said .
It was just an accident .
They were just children .
