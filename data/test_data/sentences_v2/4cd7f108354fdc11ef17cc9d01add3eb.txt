EXCLUSIVE : Gang slay eyed in Gov. Cuomo aide 's murder
The feds have arrested a reputed Crips gang leader for murdering a rival in a Brooklyn hookah bar last month — a cold - blooded killing that may have triggered a shootout 10 days later that mortally wounded an aide to Gov. Cuomo , the Daily News has learned .

Larry Pagett , a longtime leader of the Eight Trey Crips , allegedly gunned down Chrispine Philip , a reputed member of the Folk Nation gang , inside the Buda Hookah Bar on Aug. 28 , finishing him off with a bullet fired into his brain , according to court papers filed in Brooklyn Federal Court .

Pagett , 35 , then allegedly shot his way out of the Flatbush Ave .
lounge bar , hitting numerous people in his path .
 “
( Pagett ) brazenly opened fire in a crowded bar , killing his intended target and wounding five others , ” stated Assistant Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Geddes .
 “
In doing so , Pagett displayed a complete and utter disregard for human life and the consequences of his actions .
”

Detectives are investigating whether Philip ’s murder fueled a wild gun battle between Folk Nation and Eight Trey Crips gang members outside the Ebbets Field Apartments on Sept. 7 , sources told The News .

Authorities recovered chilling video from the hookah bar of Pagett standing over Philip , 27 , and firing a bullet into his head at close range , court papers state .

Carey Gabay , a Harvard - educated first deputy counsel to the Empire State Development Corp. , was attending a J’Ouvert celebration nearby and was cut down by a stray bullet .
Gabay was taken off life support last Wednesday .

Investigators believe the hookah bar slaying was related to a feud between the street gangs that has been brewing for months and was partly in retaliation for a previous murder of an Eight Trey Crip by a Folk Nation gunman .

Pagett was charged with violating his supervised release from a 2008 federal conviction by killing Philip .

A spokesman for Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said the gang murders remain under investigation .

Pagett ’s lawyer did not return a call seeking comment .
His Crips crew has wreaked havoc around the Vanderveer and Flatbush Estates housing developments for years .

Pagett ’s rap sheet includes wounding a bystander while fleeing a robbery , and shooting a man with a rifle from a sixth - story window perch in 2005 .

“
I’m not a sniper , ”
Pagett told Brooklyn Federal Judge Edward Korman at his sentencing in the 2005 case .

“ The government is trying to make me out to be a vicious gangbanger …
they’re trying to convince the court that I am a maniac that has no value for other people ’s lives .
 “
Personally , if I came across someone as ignorant and psychotic as the government is ( making ) me out today , I myself would fear them being loose amongst society , ” he said , according to a transcript of his rant .
