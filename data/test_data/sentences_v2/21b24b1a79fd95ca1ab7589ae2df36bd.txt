SAN ANTONIO - A 15-year - old boy who was involved in an accidental shooting Tuesday morning that killed a 17-year - old boy at a Northwest Side apartment complex did n't realize the gun was loaded , police said .

According to a preliminary report , the suspect , whose name has not been released , was playing with the weapon at the time .

" The victim took the gun away from him , " said San Antonio police Sgt .
David Soto .
" When he grabbed it , the gun went off . "

The victim , Diego Rodriguez , suffered a gunshot wound to the chest .
He was taken to University Hospital , where he was pronounced dead .

The suspect was frightened and ran away , police said .

After about an hour of searching for him , officers said they were approached by two men who handed them a gun and told them where to find the suspect .

Drevonte King told KSAT 12 News that he and his brother were the men who gave police the weapon .
King said the teenage suspect barged into his apartment in the 3600 block of Callaghan Road , visibly upset about what had happened .

" He was , like , ' I shot somebody !
I shot somebody ! "
King said .
" He said,'I do n't know what to do . '
So he goes to the bathroom and tries to put the bullets in the toilet .
He was scared .
You could tell in his eyes that he did n't want to come out .
He did n't want to talk to nobody .
But me and my brother knew what was best for him . "

On his way to talk to police , King said he began to worry whether he and his brother might be walking into trouble .
He said he was n't taking any chances on police mistaking him for the suspect .

" We get on our knees because a lot of black people are being killed , so black lives matter to me , " he said .
" We came and did that , got on the ground and gave them the gun . "

Officers entered King 's apartment and arrested the teen .
Although police said the shooting appears to have been accidental , criminal charges are expected against the teen .
