He 's the usual suspect .

Joseph Brown , the murder suspect who was ordered released on Friday after serious questions were raised about whether he was the gunman in a Coney Island slaying , is no stranger to false arrests , his family told the Daily News .

“ I feel great , man , ” Brown said , flanked by his family , as he left the Brooklyn Detention Complex on Friday . “
I’m just glad to be out of there .
It ’s been a stressful week for me .
Brown has been arrested two other times — and both of those were bogus arrests , his relatives and court papers say .

The first time the Coney Island native was arrested was back on May 9 , 2007 , when he was walking home after a day of work at his neighborhood Pathmark .

Brown was stopped by officers and arrested on drug possession charges .
The charges were later dropped , and Brown sued for false arrest .
The city settled his claim for $ 30,000 .

He was arrested again this past Nov. 1 , when police identified him as one of the 16 looters who ripped off a Neptune Ave .
Key Food after Hurricane Sandy .

Brown was spotted walking out of the Key Food “ carrying property ” about midnight on Halloween , the criminal complaint says .
He was charged with felony burglary , misdemeanor criminal trespass and petty larceny .

The burglary charge was later dismissed , and Brown ’s cousin Donald Franks predicted the other charges would be dropped as well .

He was just out there looking for his nephew , ”
Franks said .

Brown said he doesn’t understand why the cops keep arresting him .
I did feel targeted , and I didn’t understand why this was being done to me .
I just couldn’t understand it .
But I’m home now , and that ’s all that matters , ” he said Friday .
My family ’s still behind me , from day one , and if it wasn’t for them , I’d probably still be sitting inside there now .
Relatives predicted that Brown would be filing suit — but now he has far more serious charges hanging over his head .

Brown said he was playing Call of Duty : Black Ops at a friend ’s home on March 22 when he heard there had been a shooting at the home of a longtime family friend , Eva Natal .
The gunman and a female accomplice had shot Natal , two of her sons and another man , Angel Rivera , before fleeing the Gravesend Houses apartment .
Rivera was killed in the bloody attack .

Brown ’s family and friends said he soon received more shocking news — police had identified him as the gunman .

He was with us the whole time , ” said his friend Shawna Brown , who ’s no relation .
Friends and family were in disbelief when they saw Brown ’s face pop up on the news .
He was watching things unfold as we were , ” Shawna Brown said .

Jeff Bachner/for New York Daily News ' I feel great , man , ' Joseph Brown ( right ) said .
Brown was ordered released on Friday after questions were raised about whether he was involved in a murder in Coney Island .

With the help of his brother and father , Joseph Brown surrendered to the police .

Brown and several other witnesses spoke to investigators , and told them that he was with them at the time of the 3:30 p.m. shooting .

Brown was slapped with murder and other charges , and locked up for a week before prosecutors consented to his release on Friday .
They said they were “ still investigating to make sure we have the correct individual in custody .
He ’s due back in court on May 29 .

Brown ’s family said that one of the victims of the shooting is legally blind , and might have thought Brown was the shooter because the suspect had braids like Brown used to have .

Everybody ’s always slandering this kid , ” Shawna Brown said .
This man never killed a roach .
He doesn’t have it in him . ”
