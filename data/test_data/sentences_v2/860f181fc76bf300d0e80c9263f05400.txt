Woman gets 2 years in prison for daughter 's shooting
A Toledo woman whose 6-year - old daughter was shot in the leg in their Alvin Street apartment was sentenced to two years in prison today for endangering children .

Mecca Canty , 21 , who now lists an address in the 1500 block of Lincoln Avenue , entered an Alford plea — not admitting guilt — June 9 to the charge and was found guilty by Lucas County Common Pleas Judge Ian English .

Canty 's daughter , Za'nilah Canty , was accidentally shot in the leg Dec. 14 , but rather than immediately call for help or take her to the hospital , Judge English said , Canty tried to make it look like there had been a drive - by shooting .

She thought of herself , not her young daughter , he said .

“
There is no way I can reward that conduct , ” the judge said .

As part of a plea agreement with Canty , a charge of tampering with evidence was dismissed .

Canty 's mother , Thessa Canty , 49 , of the 5700 block of Dorr Street , is scheduled to go to trial Aug. 22 for endangering children for allegedly failing to take her granddaughter immediately to the hospital after she was shot .
