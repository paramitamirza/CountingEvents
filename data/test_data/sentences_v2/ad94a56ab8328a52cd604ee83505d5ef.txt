Woman , boyfriend killed in brazen daytime East Oakland shooting - KTVU -
?

OAKLAND , Calif. ( KTVU ) -- Homicide in East Oakland is nothing new , but Friday 's noontime murders of a young couple on a busy street was brazen even for a neighborhood accustomed to violence .

" It 's another sad day in deep East , " Oakland council member Larry Reid told KTVU at the scene at 105th Avenue and Edes Street .

Reid was among the crowd watching somberly as police went about their forensic work .
Clearly visible were two bodies under tarps and shell casings strewn around a gray Volkswagen sedan .

Police officers responded at 12:07 p.m. to the shooting in the 500 block of 105th Avenue in Oakland Friday afternoon and found a man and woman suffering from gunshot wounds .
The man and woman were pronounced dead at the scene .

Two schools , Stonehurst Elementary School at 10315 E St. and James Madison Middle School at 400 Capistrano Drive , were placed on lockdown while police searched the area for suspects , according to school district spokesman Troy Flint .

The lockdowns were lifted as of about 1:30 p.m. , Flint said .

" I heard that they tried to get out of the car and get away and got gunned down , " Ron Wysinger told KTVU as he and other members of the Oakland Youth Outreach team consoled the victims ' family members .
The team wears distinctive white windbreakers .
Their role is to defuse tension and support victims."For the family , this is going to be really hard for them right now , " said Wysinger , who lost his own teenage son the same way a decade ago .
" This is the worst part so we need to be real close to them , and walk them through what we can."One of the victims was a young man who witnesses said was in the driver 's seat of the car .
The other victim was his girlfriend , shot a short distance away as she tried to flee the gunmen."I think the boyfriend was involved in a lot of stuff , "
Rose Douglas of San Jose told KTVU.Douglas is the young woman 's grandmother , gathered with other grieving relatives , waiting for the Alameda County coroner to arrive .
They describe 19-year - old Alexis Randolph as a good girl who had never been in any trouble .
Douglas said Randolph had not known her boyfriend long , and that they met at the UPS sorting facility in Oakland where they both worked .
The teenager , she says , grew - up mostly with her , graduating from Piedmont High School in San Jose last June."I always tell Alexis , ' Please come home . '
I just feel she 's safer at home in San Jose , " said Douglas tearfully , " Oakland is not where I want my grandkids to be."The double killing at noon on a busy street near two schools drew onlookers."It 's my community , I live here
, I do n't want to see nobody get shot , " said one boy on his way home from school."They did n't make it and how many other people are n't gonna make it , " a middle - aged man wearily observed."They used to call this area a killing field , " noted Councilman Reid , who said he made it a habit to come to all homicides in his district , until the sheer volume became too much to handle emotionally .
Now , he wonders if any government official or policy can make a difference."It 's frustrating , " Reid admitted , " I have two years left in my term , and I 'm about ready to throw my hands up and let somebody else come in .
Maybe they can stop the violence."Reid says he 's especially outraged at the lack of outrage:"Where are all these protesters , when we are losing so many African American lives on the streets of Oakland ?
" he demanded indignantly , " I mean , where are they?"The family of Alexis Randolph describe her as " a big kid , " friendly , fun - loving , and outgoing .
She was staying with her Oakland grandparents , they say , in order to be closer to her job and classes she was to start at Laney College."I never ever thought I would have to come up here and identify my granddaughter , " lamented her grandmother Rose Douglas , " Alexis , I love you so much .
And we 're going to get to the bottom of this , because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time . "
