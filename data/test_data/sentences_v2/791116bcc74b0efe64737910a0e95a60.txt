Police : Gun battle , chase , brawl end with 5 shot , 2 dead in Detroit
Detroit — Alcohol , guns and an argument appear to have been the volatile mix that sparked a lengthy shootout inside a small , one - story house early Friday morning .

The gun battle was followed by a police chase that ended in a fatal crash .
The events left two dead and five wounded .

The violence by a group that had hours earlier attended a candlelight vigil for an acquaintance , spilled over to Grace Hospital , where some of the shooting victims were taken .
A man attacked another man as he lay on a gurney , igniting a brawl that ended when police arrived and arrested five of the combatants .

The initial report was that eight people had been shot in the incident in the 14000 block of Patton , although Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the scene was chaotic and the witnesses’ stories keep shifting .

“ The witnesses are those who were involved in the incident , ” he said .

What police do know is there was a shooting just before 2 a.m. Friday inside the home that left one man dead .

It appears that everybody involved in the incident was acquainted , ”
Craig said .
We just don’t know what happened to create the argument .
”

After the shooting , a nearby squad car responded and the officers spotted two cars driving away .
The police chased one car that slammed into a fire hydrant on the 9300 block of Burt , ejecting a woman , who died .
Craig said it ’s unclear whether she died from the accident or from a gunshot wound .
A firearm was confiscated from the car , Craig said .

Another female in the crash was taken to the hospital and police arrested a man at the crash scene , according to Sgt .
Eren Stephens .

The second car was also stopped and another firearm was found .
A third gun was confiscated from the house , and a total of four people were arrested .
Five more were arrested at the hospital after the fight .

Craig said many details are unclear , including why the vigil was held .
Police have gotten reports the man was the victim of a traffic accident , and that he had died the night earlier in a shooting .
Residents said the vigil was for a recent victim of violence in the neighborhood .

The motive for Friday ’s violence is unclear , Craig said , although heavy drinking had taken place .

We don’t know if this was a retaliation shooting , but there ’s no evidence to support that , ”
Craig said .

The violence at the one - story house on the 14000 block of Patton between Kendall and Schoolcraft lasted at least five minutes , neighbors said .

“ I heard a group of people celebrating , then arguing and then it escalated , ”
Maurice Westley said .
Then I heard a string of gunshots .
It sounded like people were scattering and yelling at each other .
Then I heard another string of gunshots .
Then after minute or two , I heard another string of gunshots . ”

Westley , who lives on the next block on Braile , said he heard bullets hit his fence and a tree .
He saw an ambulance take one body away .

There was a late - model white Suburban with two windows on the driver ’s side busted out and gunshot holes in the body at the Patton location .

It ’s senseless , and it ’s stupid , and there ’s
no reason for it , ” Assistant Police Chief Steve Dolunt said .

On Monday , police investigators were on the scene at a home on the 9200 block of Burt , near West Chicago and Evergreen , after shots were fired around 4:30 a.m.
A 22-year - old man was shot in the chest and died in the home , according to police .
Two other men , ages 22 and 20 , were wounded in the legs by the gunfire .
Police said their wounds were not fatal .
