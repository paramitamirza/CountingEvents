Teenager accidentally shot and killed by girlfriend , police say
HOUSTON - A teenager died early Friday morning after what police said was an accidental shooting in southeast Houston .

Friends and family members gathered outside the home of Jacob Lara in the 11200 block of Sageland Drive near Beltway 8 , just hours after Houston police said he was accidentally shot to death by his girlfriend .

" It 's my understanding this was an accidental discharge .
I do n't think these individuals had experience with guns and as far as we we can tell , there is no evidence there was any argument any fighting of any kind , " Sgt .
Hector Garcia of the HPD Homicide Division said .

Detectives believe that Lara , 19 , had recently purchased the handgun .

He and his 16-year - old girlfriend were handling the gun just after midnight Friday .
The 16-year - old apparently was trying to latch the safety lock when the gun went off , hitting Lara in the face .

Detectives said Lara was dead when they arrived .

Friends of Lara said he was a big fan of cars and sports .
And that 's how they plan to remember him , as they 're left devastated by his sudden death .

" Was never a bad kid .
He was everything a mom would ever wish for in a son , " his friend Vianey Gomez said .
"
Always polite , very educated .
So many things I 'll remember Jacob as .
He 'd always going to be in my heart . "

Police are still investigating , but believe Lara 's death was just a tragic accident that is especially heartbreaking given the circumstances and how young he was .

" I just really , really want to send my prayers to his family and my heart goes out to them , " Gomez said .

Wanda Durham , who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 50 years , said there have never been any issues and it 's always been quiet .

" It 's just the world we live in today .
So many things are happening that I 'm not used to .
We did n't used to have to go through things like this , " Durham said .

The case will now head to a Harris County grand jury to see if charges may possibly be filed .

A GoFundMe account has been set up for the family .
