 The hospital and Sheriffs officials confirmed he was the boy who shot himself .

Authorities arrived at the Cypress home in the 15400 block of Redbud Berry Way shortly after midnight on Tuesday .
Bryson was breathing and unresponsive .

He was rushed to the Texas Medical Center where he remained until his death .

Bryson was visiting his grandparents at their home .
Harris County sheriff 's officials said they were " cooperating with investigators fully . "
The findings will be forwarded to a Harris County grand jury .

Children 's Protective Services also will investigate , but CPS officials said in the past the agency has n't had any dealings with the family .

Bryson loved and was devoted to two things - his family , especially his sisters , and Iron Man - his favorite superhero .

" He looked up to Iron Man because he was strong , fearless and he dedicated his life to helping others , " the family said in the statement .

CPS officials want to find out how Bryson was able to gain access to the gun .
Last year , at least four children died in Harris County as a result of accidental shootings .

Adults can be prosecuted for making a firearm accessible to a child , a misdemeanor charge .

In the statement released Thursday , family members said they hoped Bryson 's death would be a reminder to families with firearms in the home .

" Always check to make sure you know where your guns are and that they are safely out of reach of children , not loaded and locked away , " the statement said .

Bryson , who fought for his life with the bravery of Iron Man , will now save the lives of other children as an organ donor .

Family members said he will soon be laid to rest in his Iron Man costume .

" We know he would n't have had it any other way , " they said .
