Employee tells boss to stick job , then wins pay out for constructive dismissal
The Employment Relations Authority found that Hugh Britton was constructively dismissed .

A company that believed an employee had quit because he told his boss to " stick this up your f ... arse
" has been ordered to pay out for constructive dismissal .

Napier man Hugh Britton was employed by Mulching Crushing and Screening Ltd ( MCS ) , a small company involved in crushing organic material and waste disposal .

Britton operated heavy machinery and had been working for the company for about three months when things came to a head .

Early on April 22 last year he went to a quarry at Awatoto , near Napier .
Realising he might have gone to the wrong location he rang company director Barry Maunder .

Maunder , who was with fellow company director Gareth Fryer , put the call on speakerphone .

An Employment Relations Authority determination released on Thursday described the call as " brief but volatile " with both parties swearing at each other .

Britton recalled Maunder saying " It 's not my job to chase you up , do you want a job or not ? " , and the exchange ended with Britton telling Maunder " I am not in the mood for this f ....
bullshit , you can stick this up your f .... arse .
I 'm going home " .

After Britton hung up Maunder and Fryer discussed whether that meant Britton had resigned and concluded it probably did .
Twenty minutes later Maunder texted Britton asking him to drop the ute off at the workshop , which he did .

Later that day Britton rang Fryer and told him he had been sacked .
He also rang Maunder and left a message saying he believed he had been fired and he expected holiday pay and a week 's pay in lieu of notice .

Britton did n't return to work but he met Maunder on April 28 .
The meeting did not go well and Britton walked out .

On May 14 Britton raised a personal grievance .

The company says Britton was not dismissed but resigned voluntarily .

The authority held an investigation meeting in Napier in May.
A determination by authority member Michelle Ryan has found that Britton was unjustifiably dismissed .

Ryan said that when Britton asserted he had been dismissed the company had not dispelled or opposed that statement
 She accepted that the directors might have been " more than a little irritated " after Britton 's conduct on April 22 , but " it is difficult to imagine a more definitive breach to an employment relationship than the refusal of one party to confirm with the other that the relationship remains in existence " .

When Britton told Fryer he had been dismissed this should have prompted the company " to take immediate steps to maintain a productive employment relationship with Mr Britton " , she said .

The company 's failure to advise Britton on April 22 and afterwards that the employment relationship was still intact was not the action of a fair and reasonable employer and amounted to constructive dismissal , Ryan said .

Britton sought $ 1789.32 for lost wages , holiday pay and Kiwisaver payments , and $ 2,500 in compensation for humiliation , loss of dignity and injury to feelings .

Ryan said evidence showed that Britton was not overly distressed , and added that his language and actions contributed to the relationship breakdown .

She ordered the company to pay Britton $ 1342.68 for lost wages and benefits and $ 800 for humiliation , loss of dignity and injury to feelings .
