The victim was brought to the downtown Muncie fire station , at Jackson and Madison streets , about 5:30 p.m. , apparently by her father .

The child was taken by ambulance to IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital .
Police said she was not believed to have suffered a life - threatening wound , but still might be flown to an Indianapolis hospital as a precaution .

Authorities were told the gunshot , apparently from a .22-caliber handgun , was accidentally fired by a 13-year - old boy , who had found the weapon and did not realize it was real .

The child 's shooting came about 14 hours after city police , responding to a report of shots fired near the downtown McDonald 's , found a 12-year - old boy carrying a .25-caliber handgun .
