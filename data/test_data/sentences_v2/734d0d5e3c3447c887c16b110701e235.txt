The accused wheelman in a drive - by shooting that resulted in the death of an unborn baby may have been " threatened " by the two gunmen , his lawyer said Thursday .

" My client is not the alleged shooter , the people say two others who are running around with guns are involved , it 's possible he may have been threatened , " said Quamari McAllister 's attorney , Lawrence LaBrew , during his client 's arraignment at Brooklyn Criminal Court .

McAllister and Marquise Frederick , both 19 , are charged with five counts of attempted murder , three counts of first - degree assault and other charges for a drive - by shooting Monday at the Red Hook Houses that seriously injured four and put five - months pregnant Special - Caijae Houston in critical condition , causing the 19-year - old to lose her baby .

New York Daily News Destiny Jones , one of four shooting victims , is taken from the scene Monday at the Red Hook Houses .

Special - Caijae Houston , who was pregnant , was put in critical condition and lost her unborn baby .

Frederick and the other accused shooter , Elijah Wells , 19 , are believed to be members of the Oww Oww Crew from the Gowanus Houses who had " beef " with the Gangsta Money Makers from the Red Hook Houses .

" There was a homicide that took place in March 2015 where the defendant 's friend was killed and earlier on ( Monday ) where defendant 's cousin was shot , both individuals were members of the Gowanus Crew , " Assistant District Attorney Wilfredo Cotto read from statements made by McAllister .

McAllister also told detectives that he waited on the scene while shots were being fired and sped off in his father â€™s Green Ford Explorer with Frederick and Wells back to Gowanus , according to the criminal complaint .

LaBrew questioned the statements given to police and believes McAllister 's rights were violated when he was denied an attorney .
Prosecutors argued that McAllister turned another attorney away .

Police recovered seven .40-caliber shell casings from the scene and obtained video of the car leaving the scene at a high - rate speed , said Cotto .

LaBrew argued with the judge to set a reasonable bail for McAllister , who is studying social work at Staten Island College , works as a program aide at Public School 32 , did volunteer work with special - needs children while at Bishop Ford High School and is the child of a New York State Court officer and MTA Bridge and Tunnel police officer .

Frederick 's attorney , Paul Ascher , argued that only one of six confidential witnesses was able to identify his client in a line - up .

The judge remanded both McAllister and Frederick .

Charges against Wells are pending .
