A free speech issue at a Metro Detroit employer could change how companies across the country regulate employees’ comments on social media sites .

At issue is Quicken Loans’ employee handbook , which the National Labor Relations Board says is overly restrictive in regulating what workers can say about their pay and benefits , the Detroit Free Press reports .

The NLRB declined to take the alleged wrongful termination case of Hugh MacEachern , 61 , of Taylor , a former employee who claimed he had been fired in December 2014 after telling Quicken he was speaking with the Communications Workers of America about starting a union at the company .
MacEachern had worked as a temporary worker at Quicken Loans , the nation ’s second - largest mortgage lender , for several months until he was hired full - time in July 2013 .

But the NLRB did say the Big Book , as Quicken ’s handbook is known , goes too far in restricting what workers can say to the media and other conduct the company deems damaging to its interests .
