A 2-year - old boy is in critical condition at VCU Medical Center after accidentally shooting himself at a home in Lunenburg County Monday morning .

It happened shortly before 9:30 a.m. at a somewhat secluded home along Doswell Town Road in Meherrin .

A family from out of town was visiting for the Memorial Day holiday .
That family 's 2-year - old was alone in a bedroom when he reached up , grabbed a loaded handgun off a dresser , and pulled the trigger , shooting himself .

Officials say the family is cooperating with police , and the child is being treated at VCU Medical in Richmond .

The incident happened in a rural part of Virginia , where many people have guns -- in some cases a lot of them -- but the key is safely locking them up .

" Everybody who has a gun needs a gun safe , " said Mike Snow , who lives right down the street from where this tragic situation took place .

Snow has several guns and several grandchildren .
When they come over , he takes extra precautions .

" We all have rifles , handguns ... and we have handguns in our house .
I have handguns throughout my place , but [ if ] a child 's coming over , I know where they 're at , they 're out , they 're locked up , they 're unloaded , " said Snow .

Officials have n't decided if charges will be filed .
