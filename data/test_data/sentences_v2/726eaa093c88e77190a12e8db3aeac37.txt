Suspect Arrested in Baltimore ’s Harlem Park Shooting Spree
Baltimore police have arrested a man they believe may be linked to as many as four shootings that left a total of seven people injured in less than a week in the city ’s Harlem Park neighborhood in early July .

Lamont Jones , 29 , of West Baltimore , was taken into custody July 14 in connection with the July 9 shooting of four people in the 600 block of N. Carrollton Ave .
He is charged with attempted murder and other charges for each of the four victims .

During a July 16 news conference , Baltimore City Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told reporters that police were assisted by “ tips and people in the neighborhood .
“ Four people were shot on this block , ” Batts said at the news conference , which was held at the scene of the violence .
“ Lamont tried to take the lives of citizens on our block .
The brazen daytime shooting shook local residents .
According to police , bullets flew at about 2:45 p.m. on an afternoon when many local residents were sitting on their stoops and children were playing outside .

When police arrived on the scene , they found two men lying on a stoop , another in the middle of the street and a fourth lying on his own front porch .
Each had been shot , police said .

According to witnesses , the man in the street had been gunned down as he attempted to run away .
None of the victims have been identified by police .

“ All the dudes that got shot were my buddies , ” said Keith Gillman , who lives on the block .
I heard gunshots and saw my dude ‘
Pop’ laying on his step…and my other two buddies ‘
Lil’ Troy’ and ‘ Homicide,’ who ran in the 700 block and then fell to the ground .
Gillman told the AFRO the man he identified only as ‘
Pop’ was shot in the leg .
Gillman said he stayed with him until the police arrived .
I just held him down , ” he said .

Batts said the shooting is indicative of the violence sweeping the western district of the city .

This neighborhood is on fire , ” Batts said .
I’ve been out here a lot and talking to the neighborhoods .
The neighbors provided a tremendous amount of data for us to follow up on .
Half way through the year and the city has been faced with multiple shootings in areas of concern .
”
 Batts said local residents are frustrated that people are being killed in their neighborhoods .

They are…concerned that people are terrorizing their neighborhoods , ” he said .

On the day of the shooting , resident Yvette Sarabia , who moved to the neighborhood three months ago , told the AFRO she doesn’t feel safe .

“ I have four kids and I don’t allow them to go outside , ” she said .

As of July 15 , 126 people had been murdered in Baltimore this year , compared to 111 at the same time last year .
During the same period this year , the city tallied 219 people shot , compared to 192 in 2012 , according to police .

Batts told reporters that police recently received tips that the Black Guerilla Family is trying to move into Harlem Park .

“ I will be out here and we will root out the problems that are impacting the young kids and their safety in their neighborhoods , ” Batts pledged .
