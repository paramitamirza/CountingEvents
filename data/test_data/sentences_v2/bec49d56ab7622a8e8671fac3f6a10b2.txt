John was using a horse - drawn plow when he felt something strike him in the head .

He noticed he was bleeding and walked to his home to tell his father about the injury .

The Amish family does not have a phone so they went next door where a neighbor dialed 911 .

John was taken to Aultman Hospital in Canton and X - Rays showed the bullet lodged in his head , Hunter said .

The bullet was removed Thursday afternoon and the boy was released from the hospital .
