1 dead , several hurt in East Las Vegas shooting
The last text message Crystal Barboza ever received from her son said that he loved her and that he would see her in a couple of hours .
 “
A couple of hours never came , ”
Barboza said in tears at a gathering Saturday night at the site of her son ’s fatal shooting .

Angelo Barboza , 15 , was killed in a shooting early Saturday morning at the Hollywood Recreation Center , located at 1650 S. Hollywood Blvd . , just a block away from Harney Middle School .

More than 50 rounds were fired in a gunfight and stabbing early Saturday morning that left one dead , four injured and a juvenile arrested , facing a charge of murder , Las Vegas police said .

The shootings and stabbing occurred after a fight broke out , Metro said .
It is unclear what led up to the fight— or what escalated it to gunfire and stabbing .

Angelo ’s older brother , Valentino Cruz , woke up Saturday morning to hear that his younger brother was killed .
One of six children , he called Angelo a “ quiet kid ” who rarely went out .
He just liked playing video games .
”

At 3:28 a.m. , police responded to a call reporting someone shot in the 5700 block of Pavot Court , near East Vegas Valley Drive , police said .
Just one minute later , officers were also dispatched to the 8500 block of Pacific Shores Drive , a few blocks away from the other call , to a report of several people shot inside of a pickup truck , a Metro said .

Responding officers and medical personnel found a male — identified by police only as Hispanic — in a home on Pavot Court “ suffering from what was later determined to be multiple stab wound to his upper body , ”
Metro said .

He was taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center “ in stable condition , ” police said .
The extent of his injuries was not specified .
Two other men were at the house with him , police said .

At the same time on Pacific Shores Drive , police and medical personnel found four “ Hispanic male juveniles with apparent gunshot injuries , ”
Metro said .

One of the four was pronounced dead on the scene ; the other three were taken to University Medical Center .
Two of the juveniles had nonlife - threatening injuries , and one of them is in critical condition .
 “
Two other subjects were located at the scene with the victims , ” Metro said .

Metro ’s homicide section is investigating the case .
All of the subjects were at the Hollywood Recreation Center when a fight broke out , ”
police said .

During this fight , one person was stabbed in the neck , and at least 50 rounds are believed to have been fired during the exchange of gunfire , police said .

Casings from several different calibers were recovered from the scene , indicating that multiple firearms were involved in the shooting , Metro Capt .
Jack Owen said Saturday night .

What we’ve done so far has not worked , ” Owen said during a gathering at the park outside the Hollywood Recreation Center while vigil - goers held candles and pastors comforted the grieving family members .

Police need the help of the community to address these types of violent crimes , Owen said .
He underscored the need to prevent these types of events from happening and the importance of preventing access to guns by children .
This has got to stop . ”

“ We are in crisis , ”
Metro Deputy Chief Jim Owens said , echoing the sentiment .

When asked if the area was patrolled by park police , or possibly school police given the vicinity to the middle school , Owen said that Metro patrolled the area .

Police did not specify how many separate shooters were involved , or how the other men found at the two locations with the injured were related to the fight at the recreation center .

Crystal Barboza said that she didn’t know who Angelo was with at the time he was killed .

Police said one of the juveniles they found at Pavot Court was responsible for the shooting of Barboza .
He was taken into custody and booked into the Clark County Juvenile Detention Center on a charge of murder with a deadly weapon , according to Metro .

This is the 55th homicide investigated by the department in 2016 .
