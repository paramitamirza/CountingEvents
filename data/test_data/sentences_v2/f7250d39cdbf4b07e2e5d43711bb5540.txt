Just Started Shooting’

 THORNTON , Colo. ( CBS4 ) –
Emotions ran high at a vigil in Thornton Saturday night as friends remembered 16-year - old Haley Vargas , the teen they say was shot and killed at a party Saturday morning .

I talked to her every day and now it ’s like I have that part of me missing , ” said Vargas’ best friend , who did not want to be identified .

Teens told CBS4 the party was cut short just before 2 a.m.
 Two sisters , who did not want to be identified , tried to keep Vargas alive until police got to the scene .
 “
Some guy just started shooting in the house and everybody started running to their cars , and I saw a girl just fall in the middle of the street , ” said one teen .
Nobody was helping her , so we just couldn’t leave her there by herself .
”

Another teen stepped in and tried to save her .

I grabbed my friend ’s shirt and I just wrapped it around my hand and just put it over the wound to stop the bleeding , ” said another teen who did not want to be identified .

The shooter is described as a thin Hispanic male , in his late teens or early 20s , with brown hair , glasses , and a gold hoop nose ring .

Now , Vargas’ friends want to make sure she isn’t remembered by how she died , but how she lived .

“ People know her as the girl who got shot right now , but I don’t want her to be known as that , I know she wouldn’t want to be known as that , ” said Vargas’ best friend .
I just want people to remember her as Haley Vargas , the one who was always smiling and made people smile . ”
