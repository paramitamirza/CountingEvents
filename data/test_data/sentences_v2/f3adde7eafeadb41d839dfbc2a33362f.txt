What gun owners , potential buyers need to know about safety following Montgomery County accidental shooting
Investigators say a 53-year - old woman from Covington was shot by a child at a home she was visiting in Montgomery County .

Deputies tell us the woman was shot with a rifle .
They are n't telling us her name or her relationship with the person who shot her , but are saying she 's in critical condition .

There still is little information confirmed but a firearm safety instructor explains to WDBJ7 , many incidents like this one could have been prevented .

" We make terrible , terrible mistakes when we get nervous , we get upset trying to figure out how the gun operates .
That 's when accidents happen or when we 're trying to show off , " said Joey Williams .
He has 27 years experience teaching gun safety .
Telling people about firearm security never gets old .

He informs potential or new gun owners about locks and storage .

" This cable locking device is a universal device that can be used in this shotgun , run the cable through , locking it back , now the weapon ca n't be loaded , " Williams said , demonstrating how a cable lock fits on a gun .

Inexpensive locks and safes are n't always the best product he says .
Before every gun purchase , do your research .

" If you spend 150 , 200 dollars on a rifle safe and decide a month later you need something with fire protection that 's 150 dollars that 's gone .
Think about what you need , think about your long term needs before you make a purchase , " Williams said .

Williams says to keep guns out of sight so guests can keep them out of mind .

" And inaccessible .
You have to monitor what 's going on in your home , you have to monitor what 's going on with children your son or daughter bring into the home .
Have realistic expectations of what your children 's level of maturity is , " Williams said .

Williams reminds gun buyers to always take a gun safety course before making a purchase or firing a gun .

He says if children are interested in guns , take the time to teach them safety rather than let them be curious .
