Former University of Hawaii coach files to dismiss lawsuit
Former men 's basketball coach Gib Arnold has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought against him by his old employer , the University of Hawaii at Manoa .

The school filed suit in June claiming Arnold deceived the school into believing his team complied with NCAA regulations .
The lawsuit accuses Arnold of fraud and negligence .

Arnold 's attorney , Stephen Tannenbaum said the dispute needs to be resolved through grievance and arbitration , not courts , since the coach was a union employee , KHON - TV reported ( http://bit.ly/1KDywdx ) .

" The principal that an employer must go through the contractual and statutorily set grievance process is an important one that Coach Arnold is fighting for , " he said .
" Otherwise any UH or state employee who chooses to fight for his or her rights and pursue a grievance against the university or the state can expect them to simply evade the statutorily and contractual set methods , file an expensive lawsuit , lawyer up and give that employee the runaround in court for as long as they can , and that is simply something that is unacceptable . "

The former coach has filed a grievance against the school , saying he 's entitled to $ 1.4 million in damages on the grounds that the university violated the terms of his contract when it fired him without cause last year .

The university 's attorney William McCorriston said the school expected this response and that they will be filing a motion asking for a summary order in the school 's favor .

" Both the filing of the motion and the public statement on Mr. Arnold 's behalf are indicative of Mr. Arnold 's ongoing inability to take responsibility for his actions , which have subjected the university , and its men 's basketball program , to potential NCAA sanctions , " he said .

The NCAA in January said the university 's basketball program violated coaching and recruiting rules .
