 “
This was not just a random shooting , ” said San Francisco police spokesperson Carlos Manfredi .
“ We believe one of the victims may have been the initial target .
”

A statement on the school ’s website reiterated that the shooting did not appear to be random .

“ We want to reassure you that this was an isolated incident outside of the school building where one student was being targeted by outsiders , ” the statement reads .

Soon after the shooting , four men believed to be the suspects ran away west along Brazil Street .
They remained at large as of Tuesday night .

Students and staff in the school were told to lock class room doors and shelter in place until police had cleared every room in the school .

Active shooter scenes happen very quickly , ” said Manfredi .

Since three of the victims entered the school after the shooting , officials initially thought the incident occurred inside the school and that a shooter may have remained inside .

Hours after the shooting the neighborhood remained full of police who had set up a perimeter .
Students and staff coming from the school after the incident said they saw people run and followed or were told to shelter in place and were then released .

San Francisco Unified School District spokesperson Heidi Anderson said the school will be open Wednesday but with increased security .

Three of the victims , two males and a critically injured female , were taken to a hospital for treatment soon after the incident .
The district later confirmed that a fourth student was
 also injured .

Shamann Walton , vice president of the Board of Education , said he knows several students at the school but the names of the students injured have not been released .

Anytime of course an incident happens like this the whole school community is concerned , ” Walton said .
Right now , my main concern is everyone being safe and anyone who was injured being taken care of . ”

 Walton said the school district will respond by making sure there are support services like counselors available for students and faculty to talk with .

Active - shooter training is also important in terms of the school district ’s response to incidents like this , but violence - prevention teams and law enforcement relationships with the community are also important , he said .

Stevon Cook , a candidate for the Board of Education who knows a teacher at June Jordan , said the incident is “ alarming .
”

Cook called the teacher after the incident , who told him he was safe .
 “
He said everything is fine , ” Cook said .
