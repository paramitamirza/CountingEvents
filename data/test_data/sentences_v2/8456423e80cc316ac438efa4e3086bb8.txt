SARASOTA —
Clayton Brumby and his family were regulars at High Noon Guns indoor range .

He frequented our place with his children and his wife , ”
High Noon 's co - owner John Buchan said Wednesday .
They were members .
All of our customers and members are like family .
Brumby arrived shortly before 3 p.m. on Sunday , July 3 , with his 12-year - old daughter , 24-year - old son and 14-year - old son , Stephen .

The foursome checked in and took the shooting lane on the far right side of the indoor range .
That lane is wider , so it was easier to accommodate their group .
 “
They set their firearms on the shooting table , unloaded and pointing downrange , ” Buchan said .
He was practicing all the right safety protocols .
Brumby shot first , and then his three children took turns shooting , a video captured by one of six security cameras shows .

Around 3:15 p.m. , Brumby picked up a Ruger .22-caliber handgun and started shooting .
His daughter was to his left .
His two boys were behind him .

A shell casing exited the gun and landed on his right shoulder — on the collar by his neck , ” Buchan said .
Mr. Brumby then flinched with his neck and shoulder , brought his right hand back — holding the weapon with his finger on the trigger in the trigger guard — and used the barrel to try to flick the casing off of his neck .
At this point , in flicking the weapon two or three times , he jerked again .
The barrel of the weapon was extended over his neck and shoulder area , at a slight downward angle .
His finger was clearly on the trigger , and the gun discharged in this position , firing a single shot .
The shot , as is evident in the video , was directly aimed at his 14-year - old son who was standing behind him .

The bullet struck the 14-year - old in the collar area , at which point the eldest son yelled at this father , as his father was turning around , ”
Buchan said .

The video shows the three family members reacting with looks of absolute horror when they realized Stephen had been shot , and rushing to his aid .

Brumby and his eldest son led Stephen out of the range , past five or six other patrons , leaving a heavy blood trail .
Stephen collapsed in the doorway to the range .

Range staff called 911 immediately , and rendered aid with a trauma kit .
Firefighters and paramedics arrived within minutes .
Stephen died later at Sarasota Memorial Hospital .

“ I can not imagine what the father 's going through , ”
Buchan said .
This is not supposed to happen .
 “
In 1/1000th of a second it went to hell . ”

The aftermath
 Buchan said he and the other co - owners , Bill Arkenau and Marc Rosenthal , were devastated .

High Noon 's owner said the media response that followed was overpowering , because of its scope and lack of accuracy .
 “
Evidently , we 're the most popular story in Europe now , ”
Buchan said .

His office phone rang constantly Wednesday afternoon .

“ A lot of news crews , up north and around the country , decided to report the story without having any facts or details from the ( Sarasota County ) Sheriff 's Office investigators , or from anyone who witnessed this , or from us , ” he said .
“ A lot of those stores were anti - gun - twistings — making it a ' kids and guns ' thing .
They should analyze what happened .
The kid did not have an accident .
The adult did .
This was n't a kid issue .
This was a negligent discharge of a firearm by an adult , due to his personal safety practices breaking down .
The Brumby family declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed for this story .

The wound cavity created by the small .22-caliber bullet was devastating , Buchan said .
The medical examiner told him the projectile struck an artery in the boy 's neck , glanced off a bone and then tumbled through his chest , damaging several organs , before exiting out his left side and striking a chair , where it was later recovered by investigators .

There 's no way it was a ricochet off the ceiling as some are trying to say , ”
Buchan said .
“ Everyone is running their mouths , making up stories that are n't accurate .
The medical examiner walked me through what happened , and we have the film footage . ”

Buchan said the range was built as “ safe as we could make it , ” with armored plates separating the shooters , and ballistic tile on the walls and in the ceiling that are designed to absorb stray rounds to prevent ricochets .

“ We 've got closed - circuit TV with six cameras , have staff constantly walking through the range , an instructor is giving lessons there most of the day , ” he said .
“ It 's a safer range than anywhere else I 've ever been to , but you can never eliminate human error .
 “
This was n't a range construction issue , or a range safety protocol .
This was a breakdown on a personal level , ” Buchan said .

Bill and I have pounded our heads over whether there was anything else we could have done .
There is n't — not in this issue .
I just ca n't get what this father is going through out of my head .
Neither can Bill . ”
