On Friday , we posted on our Music blog about the 13th annual White Party , a bash sponsored by the venerable 3Deep Productions crew that was set to feature rapper Wale and attendees clad in white — hence the name of the gathering .

From what we hear , the party itself , which got underway at Club Beta , 1909 Blake Street , on Sunday night , September 6 , went off without a hitch .

But amid let - out during the wee hours of yesterday , September 7 , shots rang out and four people were hurt .
Their wounds were not life - threatening .

At this writing , no arrests have been made in the shootings , and the Denver Police Department has n't released any information about possible suspects despite the prevalence of surveillance cameras in this very busy section of Lower Downtown .

Here 's an excerpt from our preview post , written by Addison Herron - Wheeler :
 Denver ’s infamous White Party , which gets its name from the fashion rule about wearing white after Labor Day , celebrates its 13th anniversary this year with a star - studded line - up .
This year ’s White Party , sponsored by 3Deep Productions and Ciroc , will take place as usual at Club Beta , on September 6 , the night before Labor Day .
To gain entry to the event , you must be decked out in your finest white club clothes .
This party is a traditional marker of the end of summer , and the last big party of the season for Denver , so it usually generates quite a bit of hype .
This year should be no different , as the famed Wale , who rose to success around the turn of the century with his hit “ Dig Dug , ” will be acting as the party ’s host .... “
I love seeing everyone come out to BETA in their all - white , ready to party , ” says Francois Baptiste of 3Deep Productions .
“ We have the best deejays , the number 1 club in the country and an incredible host to push excitement over the top .
Each year the party grows bigger and better and that shows that Denver knows how to push the envelope and create one huge night of fun .
”

The photo shared by 3Deep that 's on view atop this post shows attendees enjoying the sort of entertainment Baptiste promised .

But around 2:30 a.m. , shots rang out and four people — three women and one man — were hit .

Cell - phone video shot by people in the vicinity captured images like this one ....

 ... as well as this striking , overhead view of the police response shot by Brian McCulley and aired by 7News .

McCulley told the station that law enforcers appeared to be looking into another shooting in the 18th and Arapahoe area and were surrounding a white SUV when the shots from near Club Beta rang out .

The initial Denver Police Department tweet about the shooting was issued at 2:51 a.m. on the 7th ; it spoke about just two victims .

Later in the day , however , the DPD put out this followup about the people shot .

 A number of vehicles were hit by gunfire during the incident .

So , too , was the window of The Wine Cellar LoDo :

But while the damage is clear , who inflicted it is not .

Indeed , investigators have floated the possibility that multiple shooters may have been involved .
Thus far , however , the cops have not issued any reports about a person or persons taken into custody .

Whatever the case , the violence is the latest to raise concerns about safety in LoDo , particular during the let - out period .

Below , see reports about the shooting from Fox31 , CBS4 and 7News .
