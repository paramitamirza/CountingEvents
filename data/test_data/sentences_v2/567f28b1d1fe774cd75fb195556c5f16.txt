Automatic fire sprinkler stops fire from spreading
An automatic fire sprinkler is credited with preventing a fire from spreading in a west Las Vegas business early Wednesday morning .
No one was injured during the two - alarm fire .
The fire is believed to be accidental .

Firefighters were dispatched to Expertise Cosmetology Institute , located at 1911 Stella Lake St. , near Lake Mead and Martin Luther King Boulevards , after an automatic sprinkler activated and set off an alarm that notified fire dispatchers at 3:35 a.m. When firefighters arrived on scene , flames and smoke could be seen coming from the roof of the large one - story concrete block building .
Firefighters accessed the roof using an aerial ladder and found fire around a large air conditioning unit .
Firefighters at the same time entered the building and found it full of light smoke .
In the break room , an automatic fire sprinkler prevented the fire from spreading from the building â€™s attic area .
A second alarm was dispatched to the scene bringing additional equipment and personnel .
Firefighters had the fire out in a few minutes .

Fire investigators believe the fire started in the attic area below the air conditioning unit , which caught the roof on fire .
As the fire burned through the ceiling , the automatic fire sprinkler prevented the fire from entering the business area of the building .
Damage is estimated at $ 25,000 .

There were no injuries during the incident .
