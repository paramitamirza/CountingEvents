 Maiorana said the husband and wife were having marital conflicts .
The woman wanted to get away from her husband , so she drove from their Garden Grove home to Salinas to stay with her aunt , uncle , and cousin , he said .

" The wife had come up to Salinas to get away from martial difficulties they were having in Southern California , " Maiorana said .

Ejaz decided to follow and stalk her , police said .
He found her Thursday outside the Social Security office while she was with her family .
They argued until Ejaz pulled out a 9mm handgun and opened fire on everyone , according to police .

The woman 's aunt and uncle died at the scene .
Ejaz 's wife and her 28-year - old cousin , Alfaro Legaspi , were also shot and rushed to a trauma center in critical condition .

Witness Mark Keszler told KSBW that the gunman showed little emotion immediately after the shooting .

" The scariest part of it was that he was so stoic .
He just didn’t have any kind of emotion , anything in his face .
That was really chilling .
It was like watching a horror film , " Keszler said .

More than 10 people called 911 .
Officers surrounded and locked down the area .
The suspected shooter was pointed out to officers by witnesses , and he was taken to the police station .

" Our suspect completely confessed to what he did , " Maiorana said .

If convicted of premeditated murder with special circumstances , Ejaz could face the death penalty , prosecutor Jeanine Paccione said .

" We haven’t charged it that way , but we have the opportunity to do that later , " she said .
