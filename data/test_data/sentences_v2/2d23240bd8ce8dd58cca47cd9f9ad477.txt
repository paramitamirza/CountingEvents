 A fired Port Authority of Guam employee , who appealed to the Civil Service Commission and got her job back last year , must go back to the commission after a Superior Court of Guam overturned the commission ’s decision .

The Port Authority of Guam terminated seven employees in late 2012 , including Josette Javelosa , for allegedly helping provide illegal worker ’s compensation benefits to former port marketing manager Bernadette Sterne Meno .

At issue is whether Meno was immediately assessed at Guam Memorial Hospital after falling in a Port restroom in September 2011 , Port documents state .

According to the Port , Meno wasn’t assessed , which means any workers’ compensation benefits she received were illegal , documents state .

Javelosa , a program coordinator , allegedly backdated a memo to cover up for Meno .

At issue in Javelosa ’s appeal , court documents states , is whether her alleged actions could be considered criminal and whether the Civil Service Commission took that into account before it voted to give her job back .

Superior Court of Guam Judge Arthur Barcinas on Wednesday issued a written decision , stating the Civil Service Commission must take the case back and determine whether Javelosa committed a criminal act or acts .

The Port ’s attorneys have argued Javelosa ’s alleged misconduct amounted to forgery , unlawful influence and tampering with public records .

Her attorney argued that , since the attorney general never brought charges against her , Javelosa ’s actions can not be considered criminal .

Commission members , by a 4 - 3 vote last September , said Javelosa should get her job back , but the Port appealed the decision to the Superior Court of Guam .

According to Guam personnel law , the Civil Service Commission , in cases involving “ charges which could be a crime if the person was charged in a criminal action , ” shall determine the employee ’s appeal based upon “ substantial evidence ” that the employee committed the acts .

Barcinas noted the law favors the Port ’s argument .
He said it makes “ little sense ” to link criminal charges filed against an employee to the adverse action process for employees because the attorney general ’s decision about whether to bring charges is made with “ very different concerns in mind .
”

“
The attorney general might well intend to bring a criminal action within the three - year statute of limitations , but the Civil Service Commission would have to act as if the exception was inapplicable , simply because the criminal action hadn’t yet been filed , ” Barcinas stated .
