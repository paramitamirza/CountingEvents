Rising Crest senior killed
BOILING SPRINGS —
David and Myrtle Parsons will never know what kind of man their son , Michael , could have been .

Michael Parsons , a 17-year - old rising senior at Crest High School , died Saturday at his home at 105 Lindsey Lee Lane in Boiling Springs in what Boiling Springs Police are calling an accidental shooting .

" I just wanted him to grow up to be a good man .
And he was on his way , "
David Parsons said .

Michael was cleaning his Remington hunting rifle at his home around 3 p.m. Saturday when it fired , said Boiling Springs Police Chief Nathan Phillips .
The teenager was pronounced dead at the scene .
Investigators said Sunday the fatal shooting appeared to be " accidental . "
His family sees it the same way .

David and Myrtle Parsons were on their way to Fort Bragg when they received a frantic call from their daughter , Rebecca Parsons , 19 , telling them what happened .
Rebecca Parsons was the only other person at the home at the time .
Rebecca and Michael Parsons were watching a movie when the incident happened .

David Parsons and his wife clung to one another Sunday as they spoke about the tragic event that claimed their son 's life .

" I always told him , ' Never trust a gun you did n't clear yourself , ' " David Parsons said through tears .

David Parsons , an Army veteran , said he taught his son about firearms , and made his son take hunting and gun safety courses before handling weapons .
David Parsons questioned how this could have happened to his best friend , his " little boy . "

He was the youngest of four children and had captured his parent 's hearts as soon as he was born .
 "
Truly , God blessed us with him , " Myrtle Parsons said .

Before he was born , Myrtle Parsons dedicated the Lynyrd Skynyrd song , " Simple Man , " to him — knowing he was going to be the kind of person who enjoyed the simple things in life .

Micheal spent the first three years of his life abroad in Italy , where his dad was stationed .
One of his favorite places to eat on base was Burger King , and he could find one anywhere he went , David Parsons said .

Michael was a quiet child growing up and kept his quiet nature into his teenage years , surrounding himself with family , a close knit group of friends and his constant companion , his rottweiler - German shepherd dog , Mable , his father said .

" I do n't know how I 'm going to break it to her ( Mable ) , " David Parsons said .

An outdoorsman who loved video games and learned the alphabet by learning the names of dinosaurs , Michael was a teenager who knew a little bit about everything , his mother said .

" He was always happy , " she said .

A neighbor , who wished to remain unnamed , always saw Michael and his family happy together .

Michael was expected to get his license this year and was looking forward to starting welding classes this fall .
He dreamed of becoming a welder in the future and had already planned on going to Cleveland Community College after high school to get his certificate and training , David Parsons said .

Michael 's teachers from Crest High School visited the family , who is staying at the American Inn while their home is cleaned .

" They would n't even let us back into the house , "
David Parsons choked out .

" There is a hole in my heart .
I just do n't want to go on , " Myrtle Parsons said .

His family was thankful their son had been saved and attended Victory Baptist Church in Lattimore .

Michael leaves behind his mother and father ; his older sisters , Rebecca , Krystal and Jessica ; and a 6-year - old niece .

" I 'm just grateful for the 17 years that we had him , " David Parsons said .
