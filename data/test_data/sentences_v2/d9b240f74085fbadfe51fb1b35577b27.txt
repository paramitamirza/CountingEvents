 GREENVILLE COUNTY , S.C. -- One student will be charged as an adult after an accidental shooting at Southside High School sent a teen to the hospital .

According to Lt .
James Beaver with the Greenville County Sheriff 's Office , Braylin Scott , 17 , was charged with unlawful carrying of a pistol , disturbing schools and carrying weapons on school property .

" One of those students , a juvenile , sustained an accidental gun shot wound . "

Greenville County School District Superintendent W. Burke Royster says the student was in possession of the gun but did not fire it on Friday morning in the school 's cafeteria .
Officials do not know if he brought the gun to school .

Beaver says the student who shot will face the same charges as a juvenile when he 's released from the hospital after treatment for injuries that were not life - threatening .

" It 's really scary to just think that your relative or child or anybody you know is inside the school and is in danger , " Angela Little said , whose niece witnessed shooting .

School officials say there was no apparent arguments or fighting before the gun discharged .

" At this point , again , we do n't know quite the background on why the decided to bring that weapon to school , " Beaver said .

Schools in the area , including nearby Thomas E. Kerns Elementary , Blythe Elementary and Grove Elementary , were placed on some degree of a lockdown .

Around 10:30 , Southside students were allowed back into the school after deputies determined they were not looking for an at - large shooter .

Authorities say the shooting was accidental and happened just before 8:30 a.m. Friday .

Details about the student and how the gun got into the school have not been released .

School officials say both students will be recommended for expulsion .
