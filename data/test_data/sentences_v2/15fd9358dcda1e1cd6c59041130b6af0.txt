Accidental death or domestic violence ?
Family unsure
SALEM , Ore. ( KOIN )
— Cassie Wilson died of a gunshot wound in South Salem last Thursday .
Her death is officially being called an accident , but her family thinks her history as a domestic abuse victim had something to do with it .
 “
I’m sad that we lost my sister , ” Batisse Wilson told KOIN 6 News .
“ I’m pissed that this is a domestic violence situation that she never reported to the police .
Batisse said Cassie confided in her family about being abused by the man she lived with for about 8 years , a man who —
Batisse said — has previouos domestic violence convictions .

Cassie and her partner were together in their apartment when the gun went off .
The 29-year - old was shot in the abdomen , and before she died she told police she was handling the gun went it went off accidentally .

Batisse said Cassie was not a gun person , but she purchased the weapon at her boyfriend ’s repeated request .
As a convicted felon , he ’s not allowed to buy a gun himself .

Accidental death or otherwise , the Wilson family believes her abusive situation is what led to her death .

“
It doesn’t matter .
The gun was there .
She was not trained .
She was a novice , ” Batisse said .
“
It was a repressive situation and if you’re not comfortable with something in your home you need to get out .
She added it ’s a situation that has been seen time and time again : “
The outcome from domestic violence is somebody dies .
Cassie had a twin sister who died at childbirth .
The family is making arrangement to have them buried together .
