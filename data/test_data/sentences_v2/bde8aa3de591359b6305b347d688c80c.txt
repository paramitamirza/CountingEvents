Chicago police confirm seven people were shot inside Mr. G 's Supper Club and Entertainment Center during a rap CD release party .

The incident is gang related , police say .
A fight broke out inside Mr. G 's around 1:15 a.m. on West 87th Street at Ashland in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood .
Police say three men pulled out guns and began shooting .
Seven people were hit , six men and one 19-year - old woman .

Police say they found bullets inside and even outside the club .
The teenage woman is in serious but stable condition .
The six men shot are all in stable condition .

A promotional poster indicated rap artists Nino , King Samson and Lil Mouse , who was releasing the CD , performed at the event .

Mr. G 's owner Gene Linton said he was there , and the trouble started outside his business .

" As I was locking the door , a guy said on the outside that , ' They 're shooting outside .
They 're shooting outside . '
I allowed him to get in .
When I got the key to lock the door I heard some shots and everyone went out , " he said .

Linton confirms he heard gang lingo being yelled outside .
Mr. G 's has been there since 1990 , hosts showers and family gatherings and has a solid reputation , Linton said , adding it was the first time in a long time he 's opened his doors to a rap music group .

" I 've been there going on 23 years ; I 've never had a situation that happened like this before .
At every event at Mr. G 's , there is someone at my door with security to see your ID and what 's in your purse , and we pat them down , " Linton said .

Sherese Reed , who lives across the street , said she attended an adult entertainment party at Mr. G 's in December and confirmed security has always been present .
She is thinking about going back and says crime is happening all over .

" i ca n't live in fear and say , ' i ca n't go here , ' and ' i ca n't go there , ' " she said .

Three people -- the 19-year - old woman , a 21-year - old man and a 23-year - old man -- were driven to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn with gunshot wounds , police News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro said .
The 19-year - old woman was shot seven times , according to dispatch reports .

Two men , ages 20 and 21 , were in stable condition after one man was taken by ambulance and another was driven to Holy Cross Hospital , police said .
Another two men , ages 26 and 36 , were driven to Little Company of Mary Hospital and Health Care Center , Alfaro said .

But police on the scene said the exact number of injured was hard to determine because a handful of the wounded were driven to area hospitals by people they knew .
No one was in custody as Area South detectives were investigating .
