15-year - old killed in Cedar Rapids shooting
CEDAR RAPIDS —
For the second time in just over six months , a 15-year - old has been shot and killed in Cedar Rapids .

The circumstances of the shooting that led to Senquez Jackson ’s death remain under investigation , but Cedar Rapids Police Chief Wayne Jerman said Saturday night the incident does not appear to be an “ intentional assault .
”

Jerman said investigators have interviewed the person believed to have pulled the trigger .
At this time , the shooting is being treated as a death investigation .

“ It ’s another tragic loss of life , ” Jerman said .
“ It didn’t need to happen , shouldn’t have happened , but it happened .
It ’s tragic from all aspects .
”

Senquez Jackson was pronounced dead at 5:24 p.m. Saturday , less than 24 hours after police , fire and emergency responders were called to 1424 Bever Ave .
SE for a shooting .
That call came in at 5:45 p.m. Friday .

Jackson was found inside the residence suffering from a gunshot wound .
Jerman said the shooting took place inside the residence .
Officials are working to confirm whether or not Jackson lived at the Bever Avenue residence .

Jackson ’s shooting does not appear to be intentional at this time , Jerman said .
Authorities are working to determine the facts and circumstances of the incident .

“
There are still more interviews that need to be completed by investigators , and then we need to look at what the facts and evidence are once more of those interviews are completed , ” Jerman said .
“ It does not indicate it was a drive - by or assault . ”

Jerman said police have spoken with the shooter and other people inside the residence at the time of the shooting .
He declined to say whether the shooter is in custody at this time .

“
He ’s been spoken to , ” he said , adding that everyone inside the house appears to have been acquainted with each other .

Jackson ’s death also marks the second time in just more than six months that a 15-year - old was killed in southeast Cedar Rapids .
Aaron Richardson was shot near 16th Street and Park Avenue SE on Sept. 6 , 2015 .
He died of those injuries .

A then-14-year - old , Robert Humbles was arrested in connection with Richardson ’s killing .
Humbles originally was charged with first - degree murder in Richardson ’s death , but pleaded last December to voluntary manslaughter , reckless use of a firearm resulting in serious injury and going armed with intent .

Humbles admitted during the plea hearing to shooting and killing after two rival groups had exchanged threats through text messages and on Facebook .

Humbles faces 25 years in prison but , according to the plea agreement , he is being prosecuted as a youthful offender , which means he will be placed in a youth residential treatment center or more restrictive facility , such as the Eldora State Training School for Boys , until he turns 18 .

Joseph P. Perkins , 24 , was found dead at Cedar Valley Townhomes on Feb. 23 after police responded there for reports of multiple gunshots .
Another man was also shot , but his wounds were non - life threatening .
No arrests have been made in that case .
