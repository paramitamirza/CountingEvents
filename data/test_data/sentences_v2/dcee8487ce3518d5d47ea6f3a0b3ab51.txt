A man has been charged with first - degree murder in the brutal killing of 9-year - old Tyshawn Lee , who was lured from a Chicago park to a nearby alley where he was " assassinated , " authorities said Friday .

Corey Morgan , who was earlier considered a " person of interest " in the case , was arrested and charged with murder , according to Chicago Police News Affairs .
Police believe he was one of three people involved in the young boy 's execution - style shooting in Chicago earlier this month .

In bond court on Friday , a visibly angry Judge Peggy Chiampas ordered Morgan held without bail for a crime she called " exceptionally brutal and heinous . "
Judge Chiampas called Morgan a danger to the public and said the night Tyshawn was killed , he was a predator grabbing prey .

Authorities have said Tyshawn was lured from a park into an alley near his grandmother â€™s house in the 8000 block of South Damen .
The grade - schooler was shot multiple times at close range with a .40-caliber weapon in what authorities have said was a gang - related incident .

Chicago Police Supt .
Garry McCarthy called the shooting " a crime that shook our city " and said the " targeted and calculated " killing was gang retaliation to get back at Tyshawn 's father .

Morgan , 27 , was arrested last week on an unrelated weapons charge , but had been free on bail after meeting the $ 1 million bond requirements with the help of his girlfriend .
Police say he was in violation of his bond when he was taken into custody this week .

Morgan 's attorney , Jeff Kent , said Morgan has denied having any involvement in the young boy 's murder .
 "
[ Morgan ] maintained his innocence when police questioned him a couple of weeks ago and maintains his innocence now , " Kent said in a statement released on Morgan 's behalf last week .
"
His family is supporting him through this ordeal .
He says he had nothing to do with Tyshawn Lee 's execution .
The entire city wants the person who did this caught but it 's not Corey . "

The murder weapon has not yet been recovered and police say they 're searching for another suspect identified as Kevin Edwards , allegedly a member of the same gang as Morgan , who they believe was also involved in the murder .
Edwards is wanted on a first - degree murder charge , police said .

A third suspect is already in custody on an unrelated charge , and McCarthy said he is " not getting out anytime soon . "

Investigators said at least three people were involved in the killing , but it 's not clear yet who did what .

Police noted that members of the community have been vital to the investigation .

" This was very clearly not a case of no snitching , but there was a lot of fear , " McCarthy said .

McCarthy also vowed to " obliterate " the gangs involved in the shooting .

Tyshawn was a student at Scott Joplin School , where his teachers say he was a " delight " to have in class .
He liked to play sports and video games .

" He was supposed to play ball .
That 's all he do , all he liked to do is play ball and play video games , " Tyshawn 's mother , Karla Lee , said .
" He did n't hurt nobody .
I do n't know why this happened . "
