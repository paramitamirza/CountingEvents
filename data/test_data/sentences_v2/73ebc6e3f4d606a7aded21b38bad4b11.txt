Montclair , N.J. ( PIX11 )
-Police are searching for a masked man who gunned down four friends who were just walking down the street .

Three of them are men in their 20′s who were shot in the leg , arm or backside but police say they are all in stable condition .

The fourth friend is an 18-year - old Montclair girl who was shot in the chest and she is now breathing on a ventilator .

“ I heard five shots or six from a large weapon , ” Bernard Rawls , a resident and local pastor in the Montclair block of Mission Street and Elmwood Avenue , said .

As soon as he heard the shots , Rawls ran outside to help .

There were two young men on the porch ” he said , “
A woman was crying .
She was the mother .
I tended to the men then seeing he would be okay I consoled her .
”

PIX 11 News was first on the scene just after 1 a.m. this morning .
Police say the gunman fired five to ten shots at the group of friends then ran away .

They do not have a good description on the suspect because they say he was covered up , wearing some sort of mask .

Montclair Police Deputy Chief said , “ It is not a random act like someone came up and just started shooting up the street .
That ’s not the case .
”

Residents , like Jamela , who know the victims well , find that hard to believe .
She did not want to be identified .

They are good kids .
Loved music and sports and just tried to live their lives , ” Jamela said .

Pastor Rawls agrees to a point but says neighborhood kids have been troubled for awhile .

Look around , we have five churches on every corner .
How did we failing our children ?
” he said .

The pastor says he worries about retaliation now .

Police say they are not strangers to the neighborhood .
In fact , they responded to another shooting on the exact same block back in May.
