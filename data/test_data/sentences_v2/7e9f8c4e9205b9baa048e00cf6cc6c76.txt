: One person was killed and two people were hurt critically .

Minneapolis police continue to investigate the latest outbreak of violence on the city ’s North Side — an allegedly gang - related barrage of gunfire Wednesday evening that left a 20-year - old man dead and seven others injured , two of them fighting for their lives .

Detectives on Thursday were working several leads to solve the shooting near Newton and 16th avenues N. , which was captured on camera and widely shared online .

“
We will not tolerate this violence , not as a police department and not as a community , ”
Police Chief Janeé Harteau said in a statement .
“ We have good intelligence in this case , and we are aggressively going after those involved . ”

While the names of the dead and wounded have not been released , police on Thursday revealed their ages and genders .
Wounded were three women — two 20-year - olds and one 25-year - old — and four men , ages 20 , 23 , 27 and another described only as in his 20s .

The 20-year - old man who lost his life was pronounced dead at the scene just before 9 p.m. Wednesday , police said .
Friends on social media openly grieved for the man nicknamed “
Dolo .
”

More than four dozen shell casings were collected at the scene , police said , along with two handguns .

The shooting victims , as well as nearly a dozen witnesses , were interviewed by detectives , though police said that several were uncooperative .

Harteau said investigators would work quickly to bring to justice those responsible .
 “
Although we’ve noticed an increase in shootings in our city , we don’t believe there ’s been an increase in the number of people pulling the trigger , ” she said in a statement .
“ It ’s a small section of our population , and the same people are becoming more brazen and more violent .

“ The victims in the most recent incident were the intended targets , but this violence affects everyone , ” she said .

Recorded on Facebook

The dispute apparently began earlier in the day between two groups of gang members and ended with the shooting outside a house in the Willard Hay neighborhood .

Before the gunfire , several people were hanging out on the front lawn at that location as a memorial for one of their friends who had been killed last year .

A video shot at the scene now circulating on Facebook shows several young men mugging for the camera and flashing what appear to be gang signs .

After nearly a minute , the pop - pop - pop of gunfire begins and continues for nearly 10 seconds .

In another video posted later by the same North Side resident , a victim is shown being wheeled away on a stretcher .

Police used dogs in their search for the suspects , and a law enforcement helicopter scoured the area .
Extra officers were called to the scene to help calm a chaotic crowd of dozens of people who gathered afterward .

One woman could be heard screaming , “
Not my son ! ”
Later , she and a woman who told officers that she was the dead person ’s sister pleaded with police to let them go to the body .
They were told they couldn’t while investigators worked at the scene .
 ‘
A child in my arms crying’
 Buzzy Bohn was at the nearby Fourth Precinct police headquarters protesting the recent administrative leave of Inspector Mike Friestleben when she heard the shots .

The following day , the Minneapolis Public Schools employee found herself consoling students .

“
I had a child in my arms crying because they wanted it to stop , ”
Bohn said of the violence .

On Thursday , neighbors gathered quietly at the corner of Newton and 16th avenues N. , which bore little resemblance to the chaotic scene the night before when one person was killed and seven were wounded after gunfire erupted in the area .

Alfredo Barrera , 23 , who lives on the block , noted the recent uptick in violence .
His 10-year - old sister , Giselle Martinez , said she had just gotten home from fishing with her aunt and uncle when she heard what she first thought were fireworks .
 “
But when we heard it really loud , again and again , then we realized they were gunshots .
” she said .

Giselle called for her cousin and brother , who were outside in the yard , to take cover inside the house .

The scene the following day bore little resemblance to Wednesday ’s chaos .

Kids dribbled basketballs on the sidewalks and tossed footballs in the streets , while other folks worked in their gardens .

Gang feud
 Police say there is an ongoing gang war between the North Side ’s “ High - End ” and “
Low - End ” factions — the “ Highs , ” made up of street gangs like Young N’ Thuggin’ , Loud Pack and Taliban hold territory in the northern half of north Minneapolis , while the “ Lows , ” which include the Stick Up Boys , Skitz Squad , Hitsquad and Valley Boys , run the southern half .

Police say that the feud dates to last March and that it has been the cause of more than a dozen shootings and several slayings .

On Thursday , investigators picked up evidence , including more than four dozen shell casings and two handguns .

In 2015 , the North Side recorded about 164 gunshot victims ; already this year , it has seen 76 people shot , putting the area on pace to eclipse last year ’s total by late September .

And while the number of arrests has plummeted , the number of aggravated assaults — considered a key measure of how safe a city is — has risen by 31 percent , according to the latest police statistics .

Harteau recently expanded patrols on the North Side by 20 to 30 officers and said they would expand to seven days a week .
