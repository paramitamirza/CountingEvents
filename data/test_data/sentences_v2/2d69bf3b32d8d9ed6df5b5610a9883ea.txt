The Charleston County Coroner has identified the three victims in Tuesday 's Ravenel shooting .

Betty Mungin , 55 , Alexis Mungin , 29 and pregnant , and Armani Mungin , eight years old , were fatally shot in a mobile home on Savannah Highway .
One other woman , who officials say was the suspect ’s girlfriend , is expected to survive .

Deputies have charged 23-year - old Kenneth Ancrum with three counts of murder , one count of attempted murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime .

“ [ Alexis ] was pregnant with a set of twins , ” said Latoya Murray , of Ravenel .

Murray worked with Alexis at a hotel in West Ashley , and lived around the corner from the family .

She said Alexis was carrying twin girls , but the coroner 's office has not yet confirmed that .

" She was in her last term , ” she added .
“
She was really far along . "

Several people who live in the Ravenel Mobile Home park said what happened Tuesday has shaken the entire community .

" Nobody knows [ what happened ] , and we just want answers , ” Murray said .
“ That 's it .
He did n't have to do this .
He really did n't . "

" This guy is out here and he 's got this girl , and he 's shooting his gun , and she 's down on the ground , ” said a man who called 911 .
“
Now he 's dragging her by her hair down the street . "

911 calls describe the scene that unfolded Tuesday afternoon .
Sheriff 's deputies identified the man dragging the woman as Kenneth Ancrum .
The woman is his girlfriend who suffered a gunshot wound to the leg , but survived .
 "
She says she begged him not to shoot them , " said another 911 caller .

In another 911 call , the caller tells dispatchers a witness was able to escape the home unharmed , and appears to tell the neighbor her entire family was murdered .

" They were just so nice , ” said Catherine Hunter , of Ravenel who lived behind the home . “
You never think something like that would happen to nice people . "

" It 's just heartless… it ’s cruel , " Murray added .

The Sheriff 's Office said Armani attended E.B. Ellington Elementary School .

Murray said Armani was the daughter of Alexis , and Alexis was the daughter of Betty .

" It 's just a real heartbreaking situation , ” she said .

 Shortly before 1:30 p.m. Tuesday , deputies with the Charleston County Sheriff 's Office responded to the 5000 block of Savannah Highway in reference to a report of shots fired and possibly a domestic related disturbance .

A deputy spotted and stopped Ancrum as he was trying to drive out of the main entrance of the mobile home park with the surviving victim .

“ He shot me , ” the woman said , motioning toward Ancrum , before saying there were more victims inside one of the mobile homes .

Ancrum was put in handcuffs and told to lay on the ground at gunpoint .
Deputies found a black pistol and a knife on his person .

Deputies went inside the mobile home to find a four - month - old baby crying with his head covered by a blue blanket , and two women and a child on the floor , suffering gunshot wounds .

While some officers processed the scene , another comforted and fed the infant in the backseat of a patrol car before handing him off to victims’ advocates .
 " South Carolina is ranked worst in the nation for deadly violence against women , " said Charleston County Council chairman Elliot Summey Tuesday in a call to end the epidemic .
" We rank first among states for women murdered by men . "

A spokesperson with Charleston County School District says a team of guidance counselors and psychologists are on scene at E.B. Ellington Elementary Wednesday , where Armani Mungin attended school .
