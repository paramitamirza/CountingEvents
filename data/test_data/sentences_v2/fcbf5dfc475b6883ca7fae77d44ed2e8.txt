Woman killed on birthday , four others shot in Washington Heights
 Chanda Foreman spent the day before her death going to work , hanging out with her cousin and preparing to go out at night .

She went into her job at Comcast early , where her co - workers had decorated her desk and held a party in honor of her 37th birthday on Thursday , her family said .

Foreman was among five people shot when a gold Buick with four people inside pulled up and two gunmen opened fire from the back seat about 9:45 p.m. in the 9500 block of South Loomis , according to Chicago Police and the Cook County medical examiner ’s office .

Foreman , who lived in the 4300 block of West Ford City Drive , was pronounced dead at 10:25 p.m. on the way to Holy Cross Hospital , authorities said .

Two men were taken in critical condition to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn after the shooting , which police called gang - related .
One , 33 , was shot in the neck and the other , 25 , suffered gunshot wounds to the arm , side and back .
A 45-year - old woman shot in the arm was taken to Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park , along with a 54-year - old woman with wounds to the leg and foot , police said .
They were in fair - to - serious condition , according to the Chicago Fire Department .

Foreman ’s family members gathered outside Holy Cross early Friday morning as they learned the news of her death .
Some cried and others were dazed and said they couldn’t believe what they were being told .

Foreman was inside her car with another woman when two groups of people opened fire on each other from either end of the block and they both were shot , her mother , Cathy Geralds said .
The three others were shot on the front porch of Foreman ’s aunt ’s home , Geralds said .

Geralds heard about the shooting from her cousin , whose wife was among the victims , Geralds said .
When she arrived at the crime scene , she was told she didn’t want to see her daughter in the condition she was in .
 “
And I knew she was gone , ”
Geralds said . “
She was gone .
”

Geralds remembered her daughter as a responsible woman who had worked at her job for 10 years .
Foreman ’s 6-year - old daughter will likely live with her now .
Geralds said her daughter had been shot in a previous incident near 79th Street and King Drive .

I didn’t get to talk to her today , ” Geralds said .
I sent her a text and wished her a happy birthday .
”

One of her cousins , who asked not to be named , said she was with Foreman earlier in the day .

She was a great person , ” she said .
“ We were just saying earlier , we were afraid of these streets . ”
