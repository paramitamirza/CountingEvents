2nd shooting of 10-year - old this month has Southeast parents on edge
Monday night 's drive - by shooting of a 10-year - old girl in her Southeast Community home – the second time a child that age was shot in the Southeast this month – has parents wondering how to keep their kids safe when keeping them indoors is n't enough .

The incident marked the 19th time a minor under age 18 was shot in Newport News so far this year — one fatally , said Jamie Bastas , a police spokeswoman .
Eleven of those – 58 percent – occurred south of Mercury Boulevard .

" Past a certain time , we keep our kids inside , but it 's scary because it could go through the window , " said Dazha Watkins , who lives across the street from where the 10-year - old was shot Monday night .
She sat on her front porch Tuesday afternoon while her children played inside .

Watkins had just moved her family , including her children , ages 2 , 6 and 7 , from the Ridley Place public housing complex to the Williams Street home about a week ago , hoping there would be less violence .

" We thought it would be safer here , " said Cameron Brayboy , who was once shot in the leg while caught in the crossfire of a gun battle in Ridley Place .

After this incident , the pair are already thinking of moving the family again .

A female juvenile victim suffered a non - life threatening gunshot wound to her lower leg area and was transported to a local area hospital for care after a shooting in the 3000 block of Williams Street on Monday at approximately 11:28 pm in Newport News .

Police do not believe the 10-year - old girl , who was released from the hospital Tuesday , was the intended target of the gunfire Monday , said Harold Eley , a police spokesman .

On Aug. 9 , a 10-year - old girl and two teenage boys , ages 14 and 16 , were injured by gunfire outdoors in broad daylight at the Marshall Courts public housing complex , about a mile west .
Police did not believe the minors were the intended targets in that incident , either .

Just before 11:30 p.m. Monday , dispatch received a call for a shooting on Williams Street , near the corner of 30th Street – not far from Greenlawn Cemetery and the Hampton city line .
When police arrived to the two - story multi - family home , they found the girl with a gunshot wound to her lower leg , and she was taken to the hospital .

 People told police they saw shots fired from a red vehicle as it drove away from the area .
At least one shot traveled through the wall and struck the child in the leg , police said .

Bullets also struck another house , nearly hitting a woman lying in bed , she told the Daily Press .
She slumped down in bed to lay flat , frozen as bullets struck her mattress and headboard , she said .

" My kids would be burying me today if I had n't laid down , " said the woman , who asked not to be identified –
a common concern among many residents who are reluctant to speak publicly about such incidents .
" There were so many shots I could n't even tell you how many . "

At least three bullet holes mark the front of her home , near the front window .

Her two grandchildren who live with her , ages 1 and 2 , were not home at the time , she said .
She has lived there a year without issues , but is now planning to move , for the childrens ' safety .

" We 're not safe in our own home , " she said .

Police have no suspect information , but are working leads as the investigation into the incident continues , said Eley .

Police ask anyone with information on the shooting to call 1 - 888-LOCK - U - UP.
