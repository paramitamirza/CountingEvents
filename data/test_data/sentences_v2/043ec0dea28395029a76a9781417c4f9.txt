It was about 3 a.m. when Latarsha McKee woke up to the sound of gunfire on Garden Street .

When we were asleep , I heard gunshots , so I jumped up and woke my children up telling them to get up , ”
McKee said .

Three of her children made it safely out of the bedroom that sits in the front corner of the house , the walls of which are now riddled with nearly a dozen bullet holes from the front and the side .
The fourth , 10-year - old Achassity , was shot in the leg before she was able to escape Tuesday morning .
 “
When she came out the room , she went in my sister ’s room .
She ’s like , ‘ Mom , I’m bleeding.’ I looked down and she had a bullet hole in her leg , and my sister called the ambulance , ” McKee said .

Achassity was taken to the hospital , but was released later Tuesday .
Exactly 12 hours later , McKee was packing her belongings .

None of McKee ’s children were in the house as she packed .

We can’t stay here anymore .
That ’s why I’m packing my stuff up and going about my business .
That could have been my child ’s life , ” McKee said .

McKee said shootings on and around Garden Street happen “ all the time .
”

Other neighbors , who declined to go on the record for fear of their own safety , confirmed the gun violence in the area .

McKee said she also heard gunfire about 11 p.m. Monday night just before she went to sleep and four hours before her daughter was shot .

As for the shooting that injured her daughter , McKee said it was not random .
She said the shooting was meant for the person who shot and killed 19-year - old Zhivago “
Stank ” Hines on Clinton Street Saturday night .

They said it was because of the shooting where the boy got killed this weekend ...
I guess they thought he stayed down here , ”
McKee said before confirming she was referencing Hines .
The boy thought ( the shooter ) was here and came down and shot it up .
”
 While McKee walked around the outside of the house examining bullet holes , one man who declined to identify himself lifted up his shirt to reveal a gun in his pants , “ for security , ” he said .

This is not the first shooting north Montgomery has experienced .

The streets near Garden Street were the site of three fatal shootings in the summer .

Demetrius Kelly , 22 , was killed on Kiwanis Street on May 4 .
Steven Merriweather , 20 , was shot by an AK-47 assault rifle on Vandiver Boulevard on May 5 and died after being taken to the hospital .
Darnell Bush , 30 , was shot and killed during a robbery on West Park Avenue on June 20 .

Montgomery Police Department Lt .
Denise Barnes confirmed the shooting of a juvenile on Garden Street Tuesday morning and said the police are investigating .
She said it 's unknown at this time if Tuesday 's shooting is related to the killing of Hines .

" Both are ongoing investigations and MPD is unable to confirm if the shootings are related at this time , " Barnes said .

MPD advised citizens to call CrimeStoppers at 215-STOP with information about Tuesday 's shooting .

Nobody is in custody in either case .
