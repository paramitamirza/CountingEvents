in Brooklyn where cop sources and witnesses said six people were shot Monday night .

A Brooklyn funeral took a lethal turn Monday when a shootout erupted outside the service , leaving six people wounded -- two mortally , authorities said .

More than 40 people were leaving a service for 39-year - old Jose Luis Robles at the Emmanuel Church of God on Flatbush Ave .
at about 8:30 p.m. when three men fired up to 15 shots into the crowd .

One funeral attendee fired back , wounding one of the assailants before the three men fled in a silver SUV , cops said .

“ People ( were ) shooting in front of the location in towards the church , and one shooting from the church out , ” NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said .
Right now the investigation is early on , we 're trying to figure things out about what happened . ”

Panicked mourners and pedestrians scrambled for cover .

It sounded like a war ... boom , boom , boom
, ” said witness Carlo Stamand , 60 , who owns the nearby Cafe Creole restaurant .
“ I ran .
After that , the police came .
”
 Robles died of natural causes on April 16 .

He was a “ former gang member ” who did time in prison and may have been affiliated with the Bloods , police sources said .

Rival gang members heard about the funeral and decided to start shooting the place up , ” a police source said .

Angela Diggs , 50 , was worshiping at another church when gunfire — which was picked up by the NYPD ’s new ShotSpotter system -- rang out .

We didn’t come out , ” she said .
We just continued praying for whatever was happening out there . Praying that nobody died .
But when the smoke cleared , two men were dead , police said .
Four others , including two women , were wounded .

I saw two guys on the floor , right in front of the church , ” said witness Jose Donate , 54 .
The cops tried to do CPR , but it looked like they were already dead .
( The cops ) were pumping them .
They said ‘
Come on , come on , breathe!’ ”

His accomplices had vanished .

Other victims included a 38-year - old woman shot in the leg , a 37-year - old man shot in the hand and a 29-year - old woman who showed up at Kings County Hospital a half hour later , shot in the leg .

Some witnesses said the shooting took place after a fight broke out as people waited outside to pay their respects .

This was about something that happened 20 years ago and had nothing to do with Robles , ” a source close to the investigation said .
“ ( The shooter ) confronts one of the victims and gets punched .
That guy ’s friend pulls a gun and starts shooting .

One of the dead men had jumped in front of his wife as the gunman started shooting , the source said .
His wife suffered critical injuries .

Community leaders were outraged by the gunplay .

This again proves that there are too many guns on the streets in the hands of people who have no regard for human life , ” said community activist Tony Herbert , founder of the One Family , One Community Initiative , an anti - violence campaign where stakeholders from community , religious and business groups work together to steer kids away from gangs and violence .
This is definitely a call for the mayor to get on board with our agenda . ”

Robles’ relatives did not believe the shooting was connected to their dearly departed family member .

Whatever was happening , it had nothing to do with the funeral , ” said Alcides Perez , 31 , Robles’ nephew and an Iraq War veteran who suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder .

I was outside getting fresh air , and I ended up seeing something worse .
It reminded me a lot of Iraq .
No arrests were immediately made .
