 INDIANAPOLIS , Ind. -- A 49-year - old man is facing several charges for a Saturday morning shooting in Indianapolis .

Police believe William Zweck shot 18-year - old Kodi Pruner .
Right now , Pruner is in critical condition .

“ It definitely sucks , ” said Pruner ’s friend Zachary Rees .
I knew he was definitely going to be in critical condition when I saw him lying on the ground and his face and everything was just nothing I’d ever seen before .
”
 Rees says he hadn’t been home more than fifteen minutes last night when police cruisers and ambulances started to pack Little Leaf Court around 2 a.m.
 Neighbor Gary Patterson says he ’s still shocked that someone was shot right in front of his home .

We moved here because it ’s really quiet , ” said Patterson .
And our friends , our best friends have lived here all their life and they’ve never had a problem .
So you know , then we move here .
Nothing .
Then we wake up to this .
”

Rees says he ’s glad officers arrested Zweck and he hopes there ’s justice for Pruner .

“ Even if it was an accident or not , he still needs something out of it .
You can’t just shoot nobody and get away with it , ” said Rees .
