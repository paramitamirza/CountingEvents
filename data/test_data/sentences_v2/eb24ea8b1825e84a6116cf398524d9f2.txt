 GREENACRES ( CBSMiami ) –
Authorities are investigating a scene where four people were found shot dead in a Greenacres neighborhood .

Greenacres police told CBS4 that a friend had not heard from the people who live at 4661 Chariot Circle in quite some time .

That person went to check on the residents Saturday , but walked in to find a 2-year old girl and two women , believed to be 30 and 60 , all shot dead .

Police later found a fourth person shot at the location , who they said was a preteen boy .

“
A child , yes , which is terrible , ” said a neighbor .

Tiffany Hise and Richard Head live five doors down .
They said the people who lived here were quiet and kept to themselves .

But they said it ’s not the first time police have come to their neighborhood and it didn’t really surprise them to see all the activity .
 “
No , I’m not .
Not that I know of anything that ’s happened like that here before .
But the quality of individuals that live here it ’s not surprising , ” said Hise .

“
I mean , unfortunately lives were lost and that ’s a terrible thing , ” said Head .

Friends of the victims told CBS4 they did not want to speak on camera out of respect .
But they stood watch for hours waiting for any news from police .

A Greenacres police lieutenant told CBS4 ’s Donna Rapado for now they won’t be releasing any more information about what happened .
The lieutenant said investigators from the Greenacres Police Department and the Palm Beach County Sheriff ’s Office will likely continue working here through the night .
