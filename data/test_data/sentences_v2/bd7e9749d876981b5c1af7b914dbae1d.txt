Attorney : Teen was shot for having Wii controller in hand
By Craig Lucie
 The family of a 17-year - old shot and killed by a Euharlee police officer has hired an attorney , and they say he had a remote control in his hand .
They say it was not a gun .

Christopher Roupe , 17 , was in the ROTC at Woodland High School and wanted to join the Marines .
His friends said he looked after them .

He was a good kid .
He always hung out with me and he took up for me , ” said William Corson .

Roupe 's young life ended Friday night when Euharlee police officers showed up at the door of his home in the Eagle View Mobile Home Park to serve a probation violation warrant for his father .

A female police officer told GBI investigators that Roupe pointed a gun at her when he opened the door .

It just does n't add up , ” said Cole Law who is representing the Roupe family .

Law said Roupe was about to watch a movie .

We do n't know where that statement came from .
The eyewitnesses on the scene clearly state that he had a Wii controller in his hand .
He heard a knock at the door .
He asked who it was , there was no response so he opened the door and upon opening the door he was immediately shot in the chest , ”
Law said .

Neighbors said they ran to the home after they heard the shot .
 “
When we got up there , they said there was a Wii remote in his hand and she shot him , ” said Tia Howard , who lives a few doors down .

Neighbor Ken Yates said he saw the female officer moments after the fatal shot .

This is tragic .
She came out of this house .
She put her head in her hands and she was sobbing .
Supposedly , he opened the door with a BB gun and in my opinion I think he was playing a game with his neighborhood buddies , ” said Yates .

The officer is on administrative leave , which is standard procedure after an officer - involved shooting .

The GBI said the autopsy is complete , and they will turn over evidence to Cherokee Judicial Circuit District Attorney Rosemary Greene ’s office .

The funeral for Roupe is planned for Friday .
