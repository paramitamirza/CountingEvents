When they arrived , they found Roshun Johnson unresponsive .
He was rushed to Riley Hospital for Children in critical condition , where he died from his injuries .
Johnson was a freshman at Franklin Central High School , the school confirmed Monday :
 Our entire teaching staff met before school started this morning to inform everyone and to share a moment of silence .

We have counselors from not only Franklin Central but also from the other Franklin Township schools available for any student , teacher or staff member who is struggling .

The people at the scene of the shooting started to search the suspect , at which point the suspect allegedly fired shots .
The suspect then left the location and called police .
