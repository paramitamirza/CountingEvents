 FRESNO , Texas â€“
A $ 5,000 reward is being offered for the gunmen who shot and killed a teen at a party in Fresno early Monday .

Harry LaRose , 18 , was pronounced dead after he was rushed to Pearland Medical Center .

" He was a good boy , not sassy , did good in school , "
LaRose 's father said as he choked back tears . "
He did not pick a fight . "

Fort Bend County investigators say LaRose and about 100 other people were at a party in the 1000 block of Cove Crest Trail .

Party host , Alex January , said he invited about 30 friends over to celebrate because he was just picked up by Navarro Jr. College to play football .

" I do n't even know the boy who was shot .
I do n't know the people who was shooting , " January said .

Fort Bend County Sheriff 's deputies said a DJ at the party tweeted about the gathering and that 's when the party grew from 30 people to 100 .

January told the uninvited guests , " I do n't know you all .
You gotta leave . "

Deputies believe several young men got mad and fired about 10 shots into the crowd .

One of the bullets struck LaRose , a recent graduate of Thurgood Marshall High School .

" They was just trying to scare people .
Some people were shooting in the air , some people were shooting at an angle , " said Spencer Smith , a witness at the party .

January said he tried to revive LaRose , but could n't .
The young man died at Pearland Medical Center around 2 a.m. Monday .

In the meantime , neighborhood patrol captains at the Andover Farm Subdivision are planning a meeting Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Splash Park to rally residents .

Block Captain , Felicia Parker Taylor , showed up right after the shooting and again later in the morning .
Parker Taylor said , " We need to keep others , people out of our community that are here to cause harm . "

" I miss my son a whole lot .
He was a good boy . "
said LaRose 's dad .

The teen had started working at the Missouri City Whataburger during his senior year .
According to the family , the restaurant is donating $ 4,000 to the LaRose family to assist with expenses .
