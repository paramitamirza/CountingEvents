Two life sentences for man accused in Pigtown double murder
A Baltimore man received two consecutive life sentences after pleading guilty to murdering a young couple in Pigtown , wounding two others and leaving an infant child among the carnage .

Melville Mason , 37 , pleaded guilty Monday for the shooting Aug. 20 , 2013 , that left William Monroe , 21 , and Meghan Kerrigan , 22 , dead .
Police said at the time that Kerrigan 's 1-year - old daughter was found sitting next to her mother , patting her body .

The motive for the killing was said to be a dispute over $ 10 , and Mason reportedly said , " I am the Reaper " and " This is your worst nightmare , " after kicking in the door , witnesses said .

Monroe 's mother , Rhonda , attended the sentencing hearing with pictures of the couple 's daughter , and wearing a T - shirt with Monroe 's and Kerrigan 's pictures .
Rhonda Monroe was one of the two women wounded in the attack , and she said the bullet is still lodged in her arm .

" I still hear my son screaming , the gunshots , " she said after the plea hearing .
" It 's terrible . "

Brandon Kerrigan said his sister was an " incredible mother " who was hoping to go back to school to work with pets .
" I just ca n't understand how anyone could do that to her , " he said of the shooting .

It took me three days to get over [ the final moments of the tape ] .

The couple 's daughter has been adopted by Monroe 's brother , who moved from Baltimore " to get her away from all this , " Brandon Kerrigan said .

Witnesses told police that Mason , known as " P.J. , " broke into the home through a first - floor window propped open with a window fan and began firing a 9 mm handgun .
Mason then allegedly left the home , obtained a new handgun , and returned through the same window and began firing again .

Kerrigan was on the phone with 911 operators when she was killed , prosecutors said .

" It took me three days to get over [ the final moments of the tape ] , " Assistant State 's Attorney Beth Durand said in a news release from the state 's attorney 's office .
" Every time I closed my eyes the only thing I could hear was their screams . "

At the plea hearing , Mason apologized to the family but claimed that Monroe had threatened him with a gun days earlier .

The shooting occurred during a violent weekend in Baltimore that saw 20 people shot over a span of 80 hours .
