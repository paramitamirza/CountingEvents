Cache of degraded explosives burned in Los Angeles
At 4:51 p.m. ( PST ) , 28 companies of Los Angeles city firefighters , eight rescue ambulances , one arson unit , one rehab unit , one helicopter , three EMS battalion captains , three battalion chief officer command teams , one division chief officer command team , four brush patrols , one LAFD foam tender , and various other supporting companies all under the direction of Deputy Chief Mario Rueda responded to an LAPD Bomb Squad standby at 7955 N. Haskell Ave .
in Van Nuys Airport/North Hills .

The Los Angeles Police Department had discovered approximately fifty pounds of dynamite stored inside of a refrigerator , located inside a commercial building .
Upon examination of the dynamite , it was determined to have become so degraded and unstable as to be extremely hazardous to attempt to remove the explosives from the building .
A decision was made to conduct a controlled burn of the structure in an effort to incinerate the dynamite and render it harmless .

Firefighters took several actions to prepare the structure for the controlled burn , in an effort to limit damage and protect adjacent occupancies .
The preparation included precutting ventilation holes in the roof , applying Barricade fire retardant gel to exposures and removing combustibles where safely possible .
In addition , apparatus and heavy stream appliances were pre - positioned to provide the most effective firefighting strategy available while still providing for firefighter safety .
All firefighters and other individuals were evacuated to a distance of 1000 feet to prevent injuries should an explosion occur .
LAFD personnel were ordered to wear full personal protective gear including ballistic vests to prevent injuries .

The structure was ignited at approximately 6:23 a.m. on December 21 , 2005 .
Firefighters and law enforcement personnel allowed the building to free burn until such time that Bomb Squad personnel believed that the dynamite was rendered harmless .
The fire was controlled using master streams and hand lines on a limited basis .
When the fire was extinguished , the LAPD Bomb Squad evaluated the explosives and determined them to have been rendered harmless .
Due to planning and extensive structural preparation prior to igniting the fire , the incident hazard was abated with minimal damage to adjacent businesses or structures .
There were no reported injuries .
The dollar loss is still being tabulated .
The incident is under investigation by LAFD and LAPD officials .
Four individuals were arrested by LAPD in connection with this event .
