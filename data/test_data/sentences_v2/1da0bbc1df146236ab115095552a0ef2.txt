 MIAMI GARDENS ( CBS4 ) –
As Saturday night got underway , Miami Gardens police swarmed a residential neighborhood off of NW 187 Street and 30 Avenue .
They cut access in and out for several blocks in that area after a gunman opened fire on four men , ages 19 - 23 .

Neighbors stood around watching police gather leads , including shell casings and interviewing people .

Police said an unknown man walked up to a home where the four victims were sitting on a porch , started shooting , then ran off .

The victims were airlifted to local hospitals , two of them in serious condition .

One woman who lives a block away from the shooting told CBS 4 News she is frustrated and frightened because gun violence is increasing in the city she ’s lived in for 20 years .

The woman chose to remain unnamed out of concerns for her safety .
She said , “
My other neighbors were saying they were afraid to even walk out .
So , I’m considering moving somewhere , selling the house and moving .
”
 “
As a police department , we’re very concerned that these individuals that are walking our streets are just simply walking up into these neighborhoods and opening fire , ” said Detective Michael Wright , spokesman for the Miami Gardens Police Department .

The anonymous neighbor , who is the mother of a 14 year old boy , said , “
I’m afraid for him .
I won’t even let him go to the park .
And he ’s upset about that .
But , I value his life and I want him around for a very , very long time .
”

Police urge anyone with information to call Miami - Dade Crime Stoppers at 305 - 471-TIPS.
