 A 5-year - old boy has died after being shot in the head Saturday in Madisonville , Cincinnati police said .

Police said they responded to reports of a child shot in the 6200 block of Chandler Street just after noon , Sgt .
Mike Miller said .

Miller said the 5-year - old was on the second floor of the home with his 11-year - old brother when the incident occurred .
The older brother brought the victim downstairs to their mother and 911 was called immediately , according to investigators .

When first responders arrived , they found the child had been taken to a house next door , Miller said .
Both houses were taped off and Chandler Street was closed as police investigated .

The boy was transported from the scene to Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center where he was pronounced dead , Lt .
Steve Saunders said .

Miller said investigators are working to determine what happened and that 's it 's possible the gunshot wound was self - inflicted .

The victim 's mother is with counselors at the Cincinnati Police Department as police continue to investigate the shooting death , police said .

This is the second shooting this week in which a child was shot in Madisonville .
On Wednesday , a 2-year - old and a man were left in critical condition after a shooting on Whetsel Avenue near Chandler Street .
Ernest Cephas , 35 , was arrested in connection with the shooting .

Executive Director of the Madisonville Community Urban Redevelopment Corporation Sara Sheets explained that Madisonville is a tight - knit , multi - generational community , and said the violence is unacceptable .

She drove to the scene of the shooting Saturday after hearing the news .
In a colorful shirt that read " Madisonville , " she hugged the other residents who had gathered near the crime tape .

" We 've had two children hurt and killed by gun violence in one week , " Sheets said .
" It 's extremely sad and it 's problem that we have not just in Madisonville , but all over the country .
This obsession with guns , the accessibility to guns , it 's killing kids . "

Whitney White has lived in Madisonville for over 23 years .
She said she rushed to the scene after her mother called and said she saw the victim " covered in blood " on her porch .

" It 's just a sad case , " White said .
