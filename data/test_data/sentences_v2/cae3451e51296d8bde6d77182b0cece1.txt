A 34-year - old man was charged Friday night after a 2-year - old boy shot himself in the face at a home in north Raleigh , police said .

Jamick Dakota Corley was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon , possession of a firearm with an altered or obliterated serial number , failure to store a firearm safely to protect a minor , and contributing to the delinquency of a minor , according to police .

According to authorities , the toddler shot himself in the face at about 4 p.m. at a home in the 5200 block of Evergreen Forest Way , near Capital Boulevard , in north Raleigh .
Corley lives at the home , police said .

The toddler was taken to WakeMed but later transferred to Duke Hospital , where he was being treated for non - life - threatening injuries , authorities said .

In a 911 call released by authorities Saturday afternoon , a woman can be heard screaming as she tells dispatchers that the child shot himself .

" I heard a pop and ran upstairs and he was bleeding from the mouth , " the woman said .

After telling authorities that the child shot himself in the chin , the woman said the boy was starting to go to sleep .

" His eyes are getting weak .
He 's breathing and gurgling , " she said .

Shortly after law enforcement officials arrived at the home , the caller said that the boy was awake and talking .

Danny Royale lives in the neighborhood .
He said the child was quickly rushed out of the home .

" The infant was only wearing diapers and they rushed out of here so fast .
We did n't know what was happening , " Royale said .

It was not immediately clear if Corley was related to the toddler .
Corley was being held in the Wake County Detention Center .

An investigation of the incident is ongoing .
