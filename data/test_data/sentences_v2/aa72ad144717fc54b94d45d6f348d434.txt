Blaze Erupts in L.A. 's Industrial Eastside
From
On Saturday , September 15 , at 6:17 PM , 27 Companies of Los Angeles Firefighters , 7 LAFD Rescue Ambulances , 1 Arson Unit , 2 Urban Search and Rescue Units , 1 Rehab Unit , 1 Hazardous Materials Squad , 1 Emergency Air Unit , 2 LAFD Bulldozers with Tender , 1 EMS Battalion Captain , 4 Battalion Chief Officer Command Teams and 1 Division Chief Officer Command Team , a total of 175 Los Angeles Fire Department personnel under the direction of Assistant Chief Daniel McCarthy , responded to a Major Emergency Structure Fire at 2840 East Olympic Boulevard in LA 's Industrial Eastside south of Boyle Heights .

Firefighters arrived quickly to find thick smoke banking to street level from a 150 ' x 150 ' one - story commercial structure .
Forcing entry through a trio of rolling steel security doors , Firefighters were met by heavy fire in what appeared to be five interconnected occupancies .

From atop the building 's arched truss roof , Firefighters promptly determined the blaze had spread throughout the common attic of the non - fire sprinklered brick structure .

Teams of Firefighters quickly secured additional access and protected an exposed commercial structure to the west , as their colleagues worked in earnest to extend handlines into the raging fire , fed by floor - to - ceiling storage of flammable fabrics and other combustible merchandise .

Olympic Boulevard was promptly closed between Lorena and Soto Streets during the firefight , and Department of Transportation staff soon joined by Los Angeles Police Officers to manage traffic and the large but respectful crowd of onlookers , some of whom strayed from a busy freeway interchange nearby .

With high voltage power lines snapping overhead and Firefighters plans for a tenacious interior attack physically stymied by the sheer volume of fire , the Incident Commander ordered a swift transition to defensive tactics and the application of master streams .

The building began to fail within minutes of the move to defensive operations , as Firefighters brought several master streams to bear upon the flames , which were fed by the collapsing structural elements .

The fire was confined to the quintet of apparently related commercial occupancies under the common roof , and fully extinguished in just one hour and 45 minutes .

One Firefighter was later transported to White Memorial Hospital in good condition for a brief medical evaluation following his possible exposure to waterborne electric current through a hose stream .
He was subsequently released to return to duty .

No other injuries were reported .

Fire loss is still being tabulated , and the legal name of the business was not immediately available .

Los Angeles Fire Department heavy equipment operators were expected to be on scene throughout the night with bulldozers to render the structure safe and move tons of smoldering debris .

The cause of this ' Major Emergency ' fire remains under active investigation .
