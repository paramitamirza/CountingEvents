Shots fired at a bar on Central Avenue in Albany , multiple people injured
ALBANY , NY ( NEWS10 ) –
Police are investigating a shooting at The Rocks Bar on Central Avenue in Albany Thursday morning .

The shooting happened after 2 a.m.
 When officers arrived , they learned that four people had sustained gunshot wounds while inside the bar .
One of the male victims died as a result of his injuries at Albany Med .

The other three victims , one male , and two females , were taken to Albany Med with non - life threatening injuries .

Everything inside the bar is still as it was , cups lined up along the bar and nothing has been touched .

Owner Peter Hitchcock says he awakened by a frantic phone call from his bar manager informing him that four people had just been shot .

I was in shock when I walked in .
By the time I arrived , everything pretty much cleared out .
There was a paramedic helping a lady with a wound to her leg .
”

One man inside the bar when the shooting happened says he heard bullets ring out and immediately he and friends ducked .

He left his ID and credit card at the bar and police say he won’t be able to get them back until Monday .

So far , no one has been arrested .

Being that Rocks is known as a gay bar , questions started flooding in whether this was a targeted attack , similar to what happened in Orlando .
Both Hitchcock and police say that was not the case at all .

It wasn’t an attack on the gay community at all .
It was a private party being held .
It had nothing to do with the LGBT community , ” Hitchcock said .

Hitchcock says Rocks is a diverse bar and that the isolated incident happened in the club area where a hip hop promo party was being held .
Either way he says this behavior is not welcome .
 “
It ’s nonsense where someone gets off shooting somebody for what reason ?
”

The Pride Center issued this statement following the shooting incident :
 “
On this day of thanks , I have been reminded , once again , how precious our community is .
In the early hours of this morning , I received a phone call from the Albany Police Department informing me of a shooting incident that occurred at ROCKS nightclub .
Four people were shot , one of which died from their injures .
The APD assured me that this was not biased related but a personal issue between the people involved .
Regardless , an act of violence happened in one of our community spaces and a life was lost in one of our sanctuaries .
I am grateful that Peter , Lance , the staff of ROCKS and other patrons were not injured and that everyone is safe .
As a testament to their unbreakable spirit , ROCKS will be open today to welcome our community in for Thanksgiving .
This has been a very trying year , with many obstacles and tragedies that have hit us all , especially in the last few weeks .
But I would like to give thanks to this amazing community that always comes together to support each other ; to the Pride Center staff , Board of Directors and volunteers that continue to serve our people even in the darkest of times ; to our fellow LGBTQ - serving organizations for being true partners in goods times and bad ; and to you- for being a part of our family and your continued support ! ”

While the club side of Rocks is still considered a crime scene , the owner says the bar area with stay open for Thursday ’s free Thanksgiving dinner that is hosted every year .

Come on in and don’t let this deter you .
This is always a safe place .
We had one isolated incident that is still mind boggling that it happened , ”
Hitchcock said .
This is Rocks , we’re the family of the neighborhood and community .
We always will be and we’re stronger than a bully with a gun . ”
