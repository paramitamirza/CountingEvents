9-year - old Vista boy killed in gun accident
VISTA - A 9-year - old Vista boy died over the weekend after being accidentally shot with a gun by his own brother .

On Saturday night , Ezekiel Melendez was shot by his 14-year - old brother Jacob while playing with a gun they thought was a toy .

Ezekiel and Jacob were staying with their mom and her boyfriend at their house in Perris , when Jacob picked up the boyfriend 's gun that was sitting in a box , covered by a blanket .
Not knowing it was real or loaded , Jacob put the gun to his brother 's head and pulled the trigger .
 “
What we were told is that he shot him straight here , ” said Marisa Melendez , Ezequiel ’s aunt .
“ Jacob is taking it very hard he feels sad and he feels bad for what he did
but everybody 's telling him , ‘ it 's not your fault Jacob.’ ”
 “
It shocked me because I was like , there 's no way , this little angel could be gone .
He was just here last week with me , ”
Melendez said .

At Grapevine Elementary , classmates of Ezekiel are still having a tough time coping with their loss .
Since Monday , grief counselors have been on campus providing students with support .

“
They told us that he had a really bad accident , ” said Yolanda Sarmiento , one of Ezequiel ’s classmates .

The Riverside County Sheriff 's Department says no one has been arrested and it will be up to the district attorney to decide whether to press charges .

“
If you have a gun , lock it up , ” Melendez said .
“ Do n't leave it out in the open for a child to grab , make sure it 's locked up securely and that the child does not know where it 's locked up .
”

A GoFundMe account has been set up to help pay for funeral expenses and counseling for Ezekiel 's family .
So far nearly $ 8,000 has been raised .

Ezequiel 's parents will hold a memorial for him on Saturday in Temecula .
On Wednesday he will be laid to rest , 15 feet from his grandfather .
