The university in a statement identified the student who died as Colin Brough .
The victims being treated at Flagstaff Medical Center are Nicholas Prato , Kyle Zientek and Nicholas Piring .
The hospital said it could n't release any information on conditions .

" This is not going to be a normal day at NAU , " said school President Rita Cheng .
" Our hearts are heavy . "

She called it an isolated and unprecedented incident and said classes would go on as scheduled Friday .

The parking lot where the shooting happened is just outside Mountain View Hall dormitory on the Flagstaff campus , which provides housing for many of the campus ' sororities and fraternities .

Iowa City , Iowa - based Delta Chi Fraternity said Delta Chi members were involved , but Executive Director Justin Sherman said in the statement that the organization does n't have detailed information about the identity of the victims .

Alex McIntosh , a friend of Zientek , said he worked part time at the High Country Conference Center while attending the school full time .

" He 's very calm , very respectful , has a great manner , calm demeanor and you 'd never expect him to be caught up in something like this , " McIntosh said .

Freshman Cameron Sands , 18 , said he had pledged at a fraternity and was supposed to move into Mountain View Hall on Friday .

" It 's crazy .
You do n't think this stuff happens .
When I think of Flagstaff , I think safety , " he said .

Student Maria Gonzalez told The Associated Press that she at first suspected firecrackers when the shooting happened .

" I was studying for an exam so I looked out the window and see two people running , and that 's when I realized they were n't fireworks they were actually gunshots , " she said .

The gate to the dorm 's main entrance was closed Friday , and police had the surrounding area taped off .

Arizona political leaders voiced support for the university and surrounding community , with Gov. Doug Ducey calling the shooting heartbreaking .
He said the state stands ready to help in the investigation and response .

Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick , who lives in Flagstaff , expressed confidence that the city " will only grow stronger in difficult moments like these . "

The Flagstaff shooting comes on the same day that President Barack Obama is scheduled to visit Roseburg , Oregon , where eight students and a teacher were shot and killed last week at Umpqua Community College .
The gunman in the Oregon shooting wounded nine others before turning the gun on himself .

NAU is a four - year public university that has more than 25,000 total undergraduate students at the campus in Flagstaff , a city about two hours north of Phoenix that is surrounded by mountains and ponderosa pines .

NAU officials have set up a Family Assistance Center in the ballroom of 1899 Bar & Grill , located at 307 W. Dupont Avenue .
