A Minneapolis rap musician who put together a big bash on the edge of the south metro where four people were shot said Monday that the weekend bloodshed compels him to disavow violent messages through his music “ from this day forward . ”

The statement from Tavonte Woods follows the mayhem that broke out early Saturday at the Summer Kick Off Mansion Party , an informal , under - the radar gathering staged on rural property in northern Rice County .

Hundreds of people were at the party , where admission was charged and alcohol served without a license , when gunfire erupted shortly before 3 a.m. Saturday .
The party was at a 43-acre property in Webster Township , about 45 minutes south of the Twin Cities .
The violence drew personnel from seven law enforcement agencies .

A woman was shot in the chest , and three men were also wounded .
All four were said to be in stable condition .
No arrests have been made .

Attendee Angela Williams , 19 , said “ everybody was dancing and the music was a little loud when some stuff happened at the front gate . ”
She said there were people inside a big shed fighting .
That ’s when the DJ said everyone had to clear out .

One guy came out of the house with an AR-15 and started shooting in the air and said , ‘ Everyone has to go,’ ”
Williams said .
Then she heard more gunfire .
