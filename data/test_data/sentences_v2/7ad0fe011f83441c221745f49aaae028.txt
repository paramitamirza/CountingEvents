The man who provided a gun to the teenager who accidentally shot and killed a 5-year - old was sentenced Thursday to 11 months in the Harris County Jail .

Nima Nazerian , 18 , pleaded guilty to one count of making a firearm accessible to a child in a Harris County courtroom Thursday morning .
Prosecutors say in March 2015 , Nazerian bought a gun for his teenage friend , a juvenile , who accidentally shot that gun inside his Alief apartment , sending a bullet into the apartment unit next door .
That bullet killed Jairo Victoriano , whose emotional parents addressed Nazerian in court on Thursday .

“ His parents both shared that they weren’t bitter toward the defendant , they were just really looking for some justice , ” said Ashley Guice , Harris County assistant district attorney .
“
They wanted to hear something , anything from the defendant here , at least that he was sorry . ”

When asked what Nazerian said to them , Guice replied , “
That he was extremely sorry , that he didn’t mean for this to happen and he sends his condolences to the family .

Families from both parties embraced each other as they left the courtroom .
They did not wish to comment to media .

Prosecutors say this sentence is unusual because those facing this particular charge are usually family members , who often don’t see jail time .

“
We charge them , but when it goes down to be indicted , the grand jury usually takes out of consideration that they’ve already lost a loved one in the case , ” said Jeff McShan of the Harris County District Attorney ’s Office . “
So rarely is it charged .
”

Prosecutors say they don’t know why the juvenile wanted the gun and that they can’t discuss charges or details of his case because he ’s a juvenile .

Nazerian ’s charge , a Class A misdemeanor , carried a maximum of 12 months in jail .
