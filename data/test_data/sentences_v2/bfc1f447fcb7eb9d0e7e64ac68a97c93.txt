 PINE HILLS , Fla. - Police were investigating a shooting in Pine Hills on North Lane Parkway that sent five people to the hospital late Sunday .

One of the victims , Jeffery Webb , 47 , later died , police said .

Officials said Webb and four others , including a 15-year - old boy , were shot outside a Pine Hills convenience store in the North Lane Plaza , just before 10 p.m.
 Friends said Webb had a wife and five children , and was well - liked in the community .

“
He was like a father to me , put it like that , he was a father , ” said friend Andre Brooks .
“ It could have been me or anybody else , but out of all people , why him ?
Because that man got a family .
”

Three of the victims were taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center and two were taken to Arnold Palmer Children 's Hospital , officials said .

“
He was a real cool person .
Everybody loved him , ” Brooks said .

Witnesses said they heard between 20 and 30 shots fired during the incident .

The incident comes after two fatal shootings in the Pine Hills neighborhood in the past few weeks .

Sunday 's shooting took place less than five minutes from another Pine Hills shooting scene last week that resulted in the death of a 27-year - old mother , who was caught in the crossfire .

Kendra Lewis was sitting in her car at a gas station with her 5-year - old child when she was hit by a bullet during a nearby shootout Wednesday .

She died the next day .

Gregory Whitbeck , 55 , was shot and killed as he walked into a Pine Hills dialysis center on Dec. 2 .

Two people have been arrested and charged in each incident .

City Commissioner Regina Hill wrote a statement on her Facebook page , saying in part , “
I 'm starting to believe we do need a curfew for kids under 18 .
”
 Hill told Channel 9 that she will talk to other city council members to get their opinions about the suggested curfew .

“ I know it sounds pretty radical , but I 'm not alone , ” said Hill .

The killing did not happen in her district , but Hill said now is the time to consider all options to try to end the violence .

“ We 've tried everything else .
I need to see if this may work , ” she said .

The names and conditions of the four victims who remained hospitalized after Sunday ’s shooting were not released .
