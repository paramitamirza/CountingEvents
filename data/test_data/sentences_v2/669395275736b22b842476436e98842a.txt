Police say four men were shot at a community center in New Jersey Tuesday night .

The men , all between 21 and 30 years old , were standing in the vestibule of the Mickey Walker Community Center in Elizabeth at about 10:30 p.m. when three men in hooded sweatshirts and dark masks walked up and opened fire , police say .
At least two of the three suspects had guns .

All four men were hit at least once , and the gunmen ran from the scene .

Witness Fabrice Juin said he heard about six or seven shots while he was inside his home .

" It sounded like a shot gun , just straight bullets , "
Juin said .

The victims were all taken to University Hospital in Newark .
One sustained serious injuries and the other three are in stable condition .

No arrests have been made .

Crews were at the center , which houses a gymnasium and playground , patching apparent bullet holes in the center 's doors on Wednesday .

Fernando Rodriguez , who works at the nearby Rally Autobody , said the neighborhood is no stranger to violence , so he was n't surprised to hear about the shooting .

" It just surprised me because there are young kids inside there , " Rodriguez said .

Anyone with information on the gunmen is asked to call the Elizabeth Police Department at 908 - 558 - 2050 .
