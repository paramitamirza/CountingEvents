HERKIMER , N.Y. -
A man opened fire at a car wash and a barbershop a mile apart Wednesday morning , killing four people and wounding at least two others , and a 64-year - old suspect is being sought , police said .

Authorities are looking for Kurt Myers , said Joseph Malone , the police chief for Herkimer and Mohawk .
Officials say guns and ammunition were found inside his Mohawk apartment after emergency crews were sent to a fire there Wednesday morning .

Soon after , two people were fatally shot and two others wounded at John 's Barber Shop , around the corner from the apartment , police said .
The second shooting happened about a mile away in Herkimer , where two people were killed at Gaffey 's Fast Lube and Car Wash , authorities said .

The two villages are about 65 miles east of Syracuse , on opposite sides of the Mohawk River in a region known as the Mohawk Valley .

Officials said Meyers remained at large Wednesday afternoon .

Late Wednesday morning , police SWAT teams and a helicopter converged on a jewelry store in Herkimer .

The Utica Observer - Dispatch reported that police were focusing on Freddy 's Jewelers on Main Street , near the car wash and oil change business .
The newspaper reported that officials in Mohawk , however , seemed to think the suspect was still on foot somewhere .
Other reports suggested he may have been picked up by a taxi .

Herkimer County Community College and local schools are on lockdown .
The college sent an automated cellphone alert around 10:40 a.m. , telling students and staff that there was an " active shooter " in the area .
The message identified the gunman as a man in his 60s , with a white beard and driving a red Jeep Cherokee .
A text alert a few minutes later said the campus was on lockdown .
Another alert advised people to remain inside buildings until further notice .

Amanda Viscomi , Herkimer 's acting clerk - treasurer for the village of 7,700 , told The Associated Press the shooting at Gaffey 's happened a few blocks from village hall .
She said she was told the shooter was at large and that state police , sheriff 's deputies and other police were swarming the area .

" Everybody 's on lockdown , all the schools , the college , the village , " Viscomi said .
" It 's very , very scary . "

Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the head of the state police are on their way to the area and are expected to brief the media later in the day .

Herkimer is named for the German immigrant family that settled in the western Mohawk Valley in the 1720s .
The economically distressed villages are two miles away from Ilion , where a 2-century - old Remington Arms gun plant is a major employer .
