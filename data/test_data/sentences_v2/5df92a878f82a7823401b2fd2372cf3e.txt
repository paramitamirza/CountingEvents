The 4-year - old girl was rushed to Kosair Children 's Hospital , where she had to have surgery .

Right now , her father is not facing any charges .

Emergency responders rushed to a home on Lowell Avenue on Sunday morning .

" And they were all going into the house next door and I did n't know what in the world had happened , " said neighbor Pat Thompson .

Thompson became emotional when she learned what they found inside .

Police said her neighbor accidentally shot his 4-year - old daughter in the lower leg .

“ I ca n't stand for a child to get hurt .
It tears me up , " Thompson said .

Police Chief Tim Hazlette believes the gun went off while the man was getting ready to put it away after cleaning and repairing the .40 caliber handgun .
 “
And reloaded it and chambered around to place it back in storage and during chambering the round , it discharged unintentionally , " Hazlette said .

" I know he did not do it on purpose .
He would not hurt his child , " Thompson said .

Thompson has been tracking the girl 's recovery on her mother 's Facebook page .

“ She really seems in good spirits and she said that they were going to hopefully ... uh ...
the little girl would get out into a regular room today , and she was still asking for prayers , " she said .

Hazlette urges gun owners to use an abundance of caution , especially around their children .

“ I think there is a standard of care that can not be overemphasized , I think , when dealing with firearms , " Hazlette said .

" If you 've got a young child like that .
Especially if they 're in the house .
I do n't think you should get the gun out , " Thompson said .
" I’m happy that she 's alive . Lord . "
