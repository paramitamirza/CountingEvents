Four men fatally shot in San Francisco 's Hayes Valley neighborhood Friday night were inside a stolen car , police said Saturday .

When police arrived at the 200 block of Page Street around 10 p.m. on a report of multiple shooting victims , they found four victims shot to death in a car , Lt .

SFPD spokesperson Albie Esparza said the victims were in a stolen car that was double parked on the street .
Police are working to verify the make and model of a car that was seen speeding away from the shooting and if it is related to the homicide , Esparza said .

Neighbors in the area said they heard rapid gunfire , almost like firecrackers , and what sounded like a car crash .
Some bullets went through nearby homes , one even lodged into someone 's refrigerator .

Police told NBC Bay Area the area has a history of gang violence .

" We do n't know that 's what happened here just yet , " Chaplin said .
" Our gang taskforce unit is on scene and they will be looking into that aspect . "

But neighbors said the shooting came as a shock because lately , the area has been safe .

Police say a semi - automatic weapon was used , and a newer model gray Scion was seen leaving the area .
