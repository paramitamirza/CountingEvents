 Man kills self after shooting , wounding girlfriend and her son in Gloucester County Nov 25
 A Gloucester County man shot his girlfriend and her 9-year - old son , wounding both early Friday before apparently killing himself with the handgun , officials said .

The Gloucester County Prosecutor ’s Office said the shooting grew out of an argument Thursday between Robert Long , 48 , and Melissa Cakmak , 41 , in their home on Poplar Lane in Monroe Township .

According to officials , Cakmak asked Long to leave and he went to another home in the township , where he got into a physical fight .

He left before police arrived but was later stopped by a Monroe police officer and served with a warrant for driving while intoxicated , the prosecutor ’s office said in a statement .
He was released in the care of a relative .

About 1:30 a.m. Friday , Cakmak awoke to find Long there , the statement said .
He pulled out a handgun and fired twice , hitting the woman in the torso and grazing the boy ’s hand .

The mother and son fled the house , leaving Long in the house .
They were taken to Cooper University Hospital in Camden and are expected to survive .

In the meantime , police from Monroe and neighboring towns responded to a report of shots fired and surrounded the house .

Unsure of Long ’s whereabouts , the Gloucester County Special Weapons and Tactics unit was called in and entered the house about 5 a.m.

Inside they found Long dead with the handgun nearby .

 Blood dotted the front porch and shattered glass from a storm door had been swept into a pile Friday afternoon at the home where the shooting occurred .

A green child 's bicycle rested against the porch , and a basketball hoop stood on the street out front .

Tony DiLeonardo , 48 , who lives several houses down , said he woke up to go to the bathroom early Friday when he saw SWAT teams outside .

" It was just cops everywhere , " he said .

He said a SWAT truck drove through the corner of his front lawn and ran over a Chinese maple tree , as officers tried to get closer to the house where Long was found .
Tire tracks could be seen Friday next to the tree , which was leaning toward the ground .
