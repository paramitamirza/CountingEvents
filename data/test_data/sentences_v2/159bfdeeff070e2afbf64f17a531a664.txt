Residents at a Bastrop apartment complex awoke Sunday morning to find the remnants of a bloody shooting the night before still lingering outside their doors — police gloves and crime scene tape on the lawn , glass shattered from a neighbor ’s window and four orange markings tracing the spots where the bodies of a man , two women and a small child had lain .

Another child had been taken Saturday night to a hospital , but her injuries were not expected to be life - threatening .

Police would not confirm that , saying the investigation was ongoing .
The Travis County medical examiner ’s office is completing autopsies on the victims .

“ I want to be as confident ( with information ) as we can be , especially with an incident that is so dynamic and so close to the community , ”

Those who live at the complex described three of the dead as a typically happy family — a husband and wife and their young son — the father inclined toward heavy drinking , according to neighbor Sonia McQueen , but hardworking and well - liked .

They were always happy , ” neighbor Angela Myers said .
Never aggressive .
”

Martha Hernandez , who lives next door , called the child who died the “ sweetest little boy . ”

Nino was identified by some neighbors as a baby sitter , and they said the child who was hospitalized after the shooting was her daughter .

Hernandez was home Saturday night with her 17-year - old daughter when the sound of gunfire rang throughout their apartment .
They walked outside to see the bodies in the grass and called police .

It was all blood , ” Hernandez said .

One woman was found resting on top of a child , as if attempting to shield him from gunfire , residents said .
The second child was wandering in tears amid the bodies .

“ I told her to run , ” said Myers , who later brought the toddler to a local emergency room .
“ She kept saying her mom ’s dead , her mom ’s dead . ”

The incident , which began shortly after 6 p.m. , occurred at the Arbors of Bastrop Apartments in the 200 block of Childers Street , in a busy commercial part of town .
Residents described the area as peaceful .

At the time , a small group was cooling off in the pool a few yards away .
Neighbors said they heard as many as eight gunshots .
Officers responded within minutes , they said .

Bastrop police combed the crime scene into the wee hours of Sunday morning , as residents huddled in groups behind a line of crime scene tape .
Several said they feared for their safety .
However , in a briefing with reporters Saturday night , Bastrop police Detective Vicky Steffanic assured the public that no one was in any danger .

The Bastrop County sheriff ’s office and the Texas Rangers are assisting police in the investigation .
Authorities would not disclose further details about what led to the gruesome deaths Saturday night .

For those close by , Sunday was a day of shock .

I cried all afternoon , ” apartment complex resident Bill Browning said .
It was horrible .

“ When you’re standing right there and looking , it ’s one of the most horrible things you’ve ever seen . ”
