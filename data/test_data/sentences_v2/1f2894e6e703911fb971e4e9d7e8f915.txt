 DALLAS ( CBSDFW.COM ) –
Police with the Dallas Independent School District explained that a “ breach of security ” made it possible for a student to bring a loaded pistol into Kimball High School on Monday .
The teen accidentally shot himself while on campus , and the incident now has some parents wondering what is being done to make sure that an incident like this does not happen again .

Classes started on Tuesday morning without a hitch .
But , a police car was parked in the driveway of the campus , extra officers were on hand , and there were many nervous parents voicing concerns about student safety .
Superintendent Michael Hinojosa will be at Kimball High School on Tuesday night , meeting with parents and giving them a chance to ask questions .

The meeting was already planned , but was originally scheduled to discuss student achievement .
The tone may change after the gun scare on Monday .

According to DISD police , the 15-year - old had a small derringer pistol in his front pocket .
It went off , and the bullet struck the teen in the hand and the leg .
His injuries are serious , but not life threatening .

Police stated that the student with the gun arrived on campus after the school day had begun .
He had come to the school with his mother for an unplanned parent - teacher conference .
After reviewing surveillance camera video , the district chief said that the metal detector was working properly .
However , somebody watching the detector either failed to conduct a more thorough check of the student after it sounded , or let their guard down because the teen was accompanied by a parent .

The school was briefly locked down Monday and students were told to “
shelter in place ” until the campus was secured .
When word spread of a shooting , many parents went to the school worried about their children .
This changes a lot of things for a lot of parents , ” said mother Eva Alejandro .
Really , how safe are our children ? ”

So far , it is not known why the teen had a loaded gun in the first place .
We’re doing something called victimology — the things that led up to the incident that took place yesterday , what was going on in that student ’s life in those days leading up to why he brought this gun on the campus , ” said Chief Craig Miller with the DISD Police Department .
I think we’ll have a better idea .
”

While authorities are calling this an accidental shooting , parent Lashell Booker believes that the teen may have had an ulterior motive .
“ It ’s not an accident , ” she said .
I’m thinking , ‘
What are his intentions ?
Why was the gun in his backpack ? ' ”

The community conversation with Hinojosa will take place at 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday night at Kimball High School , located at 3606 South Westmoreland Road .
Officials are expecting a big parent turnout .
