 A shooting in the 600 block of East Lakeshore Drive in Lake Stevens just before 10:00 Friday night has left a 3-year - old boy fighting for his life .

Neighbor Buzz McLeod said he arrived home after the shooting .
Soon after that , medics showed up .

" The owner of that unit was watching the grandson and his son , while his wife and the lady were out , " said McLeod , who lives below the units .

The condo is owned by 46-year - old Jon Holzwarth .
An internet search revealed he is in the internet security and firearms businesses .

According to Snohomish County deputies , the shooting happened in a bedroom that was locked .

Holzwarth told them he heard a loud boom and ran to the bedroom where his son , Michael , and his neighbor 's 4-year - old grandson were playing .

He forced the locked door open and initially thought his son had gotten hurt that way .

At Providence Everett Medical Center , doctors discovered the boy had been shot in the mouth .

He was airlifted to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle .

No one answered at Holzwarth 's door where a sign reads : " We do n't dial 9 - 1 - 1 " with a metal cutout of a pistol dangling below .

There were also emblems about guns on his Jeep .

On Saturday , his son was struggling to survive from a gunshot wound -- a tragic irony not lost on his neighbor .

" I do n't agree with the guns , " said McLeod .
" You kind of get a little concerned when someone even has a gun . "

McLeod was worried about Michael .
" He 's a cute boy , " he said .

Snohomish County Sheriff â€™s deputies have said nothing about the make or model of the gun nor who owns it .

They are calling the shooting accidental but say they are still investigating .

They have not said if the gun 's owner will face any charges .
