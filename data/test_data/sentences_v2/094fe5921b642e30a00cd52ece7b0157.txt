Six people injured in East Palo Alto shooting
Five people were shot and a 6-year - old girl was injured in East Palo Alto on Sunday afternoon near a McDonald 's on University Avenue , according to police .

The shootings were picked up by the ShotSpotter gunshot detection system , and several residents called 911 shortly after 2:45 p.m.
The incident occurred near a bus stop on Bay Road adjacent to the west side of a McDonald 's at 2401 University Ave .
, East Palo Alto police Captain John Cook said .

Four young Hispanic males and a grandmother police also described as Hispanic waiting near the SamTrans bus shelter were shot and received non - life - threatening injuries .
The child was injured after falling as she ran away , he said .
The grandmother and child are not associated with the other victims , he said .
All six were taken to Stanford Hospital for treatment .

The shooter is a young Hispanic male who fired from a smaller early 90s vehicle , possibly a gray or silver car , which police called a vehicle of interest .

Cooks said in an earlier interview that two males are being sought .

The small car approached from northbound Bay Road .
The car stopped directly in front of the bus stop , then several shots were fired at the victims from the inside of the vehicle .

Police are currently assessing video from nearby businesses , Cook said .
The Cinco de Mayo Day shootings follow a Saturday night incident , in which a man was shot in the torso on Pulgas Street .
Cook said the vehicle in that shooting appears to be larger and different .

Cook said he did not know how many shots were fired , but some casings were found on Gloria Way .

Police from Palo Alto and Menlo Park also arrived on scene and cordoned off Bay Road and McDonald 's from University Avenue to Gloria Way .
Menlo Park firefighters arrived on scene to treat the victims , finding some inside the McDonald 's and some outside .

Cook said all were shot outside , but two ran into the restaurant after being struck .
No one was injured inside .

Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said most of the injuries were to the victims ' lower extremities .
One man in his 20s had more serious injuries .
