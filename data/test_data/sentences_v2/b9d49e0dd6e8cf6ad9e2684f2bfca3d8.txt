( 10/31/16 ) - Two children , a five year and a six year old were injured in an accidental shooting in Mid - Michigan .

The shooting happened at around 10:30 a.m. Monday in Clare , on Schoolcrest Ave .
near Deer Lake Road , not far from Clare High School .

The kids are going to be OK.
We understand one child , the five year old , was in a car in the driveway of a home on Schoolcrest , when he found a handgun in the car and pulled the trigger .

Police tell us the 5-year - old boy found the gun somewhere in the car , and when he pulled the trigger , the gunshot injured his hand and it also his 6-year - old sister in the thigh , who was getting into the car .

The children were getting into the car because their grandmother was getting ready to take them to a home where the children are homeschooled .

No adults were in the car .

When emergency responders arrived , the children were immediately taken to the Clare hospital and then taken to Covenant Healthcare in Saginaw where they have non - life threatening injuries .

The nine millimeter handgun was registered to a male member of the family who had a concealed pistol license .

Clare Police Chief Brian Gregory says this is reminder to anyone to know where their firearms are at all times and that they are properly secured .

The chief says the police report will be forwarded to the prosecutor 's office to review for possible criminal charges .
