Boy , 6 , dies after shooting at Townville Elementary ; 2 injured ; teen in custody
A 14-year - old is in custody after a shooting at an Upstate elementary school Wednesday afternoon fatally wounded one student , and injured another and a teacher .
That attack followed a shooting at a home a few miles from the school in which the teen 's father was killed .

The teen is being held at the Greenville County Detention Center Juvenile Facility , Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said .

The shooting happened shortly before 2 p.m. at Townville Elementary School at 105 State Road in Townville in Anderson County , Lt .
Sheila Cole , with the Anderson County Sheriff 's Office , said .

ACSO Capt .
Garland Major said one of the 6-year - old boys was shot in the foot , the other in the leg and first - grade teacher Meghan Hollingsworth in the shoulder .

One of the injured boys , Jacob Hall , was airlifted to Greenville Memorial Hospital where he underwent surgery Wednesday afternoon .
Jacob died Saturday at 12:56 p.m. , Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said .

The second boy and the teacher , Meghan Hollingsworth , were taken by ambulance to AnMed .
They were treated and released Wednesday , Ross Norton with AnMed said .

A note on the door of Hollingsworth 's home Thursday morning said her family appreciates people 's concern .
But she asks those coming to her home to respect their privacy .
The note says she 's not interested in giving any interviews .

A truck , believed to have been driven by the teen , crashed into a fence surrounding the playground and was left there .

Anderson County Deputy Chief Keith Smith said the shooting happened on the playground and the shooter never got inside the school .

Jamie Brock , 30-year veteran volunteer firefighter who responded to the school after the shooting , took down the suspect on the playground , Smith said .

Brock was not armed , officials said .

Sheriff John Skipper said Brock likely prevented more shots from being fired by confronting the shooter and taking him down .
 "
Mr. Brock is a big fellow , " Skipper said .

Scott Stoller , with Anderson County Emergency Medical Services , said Brock wants to stay quiet and humble , and said he did " what any other firefighter would do . "

The teen was armed with a handgun , ACSO Capt .
Garland Major said .
He said the shooting had no racial or terrorist undertones .

Investigators said there is no known relationship between the suspected shooter and the victims at the school .

Armed officers were at the school about seven minutes after the call and the suspect was in custody in less than an hour , officials said .

Shooting suspect 's father found dead
 The Anderson County Coroner 's Office is also investigating the death of the shooter 's father , 47-year - old Jeffrey Dewitt Osborne at his home on Osborne Road in Townville .
The location is a little more than 3 miles from school .

Jeffrey Osborne was shot to death , Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said .

The teen is the suspect in his father 's death , Skipper said .

Shore said the teen called his grandparents on his cellphone at 1:44 p.m.
The grandmother said he was crying and so upset she could n't understand him , so she and her husband went to Osborne 's home to see if their grandson was there .
The grandson was not there , but they found their son 's body .

At 1:45 p.m. , a teacher called to report the shooting at the school .

Osborne 's wife released a statement Thursday morning through her pastor .

Impact on the Townville community
 Dr. Joanne Avery , Anderson County District 4 superintendent , said there are video cameras in the school , and though the school does not have a resource officer , the staff has had lots of active shooter training and that helped during and after the shooting .

Avery said school at Townville Elementary is canceled for rest of week and counseling services will be available .

“ We are heartbroken about this senseless act of violence , ” Avery said

She asked that everyone keep the community in prayer .

Gov. Nikki Haley released a statement saying : " As we work together with law enforcement to make sure they have the support they need to investigate what happened in Townville , Michael and I ask that everyone across South Carolina join us in praying for the entire Townville Elementary School family and those touched by today 's tragedy . "

Haley arrived in the Upstate Wednesday evening , but she did not make any public appearances .

Moments of panic for parents

After the shooting , students were evacuated and moved by bus to Oakdale Baptist Church at 6724 Highway 24 in Townville .

Jamie Meredith , a student ’s mother , spoke to News 4 ’s Mandy Gaither just after she was reunited with her daughter .

" I just pray for those families .
I pray for those kids , ” she said .
“
I thank God it was n't mine , but I feel so bad for them and I 'm just going to pray that they 're OK and I don’t know if they 're my daughter 's classmates or they 're somebody I knew .
I do n't know .
( I ) just feel so bad .
 “
She said they went in the bathroom .
I do n't know how they knew to go in the bathroom , but I know her teacher was shaken up .
I know all the kids were scared .
There was a bunch of kids crying .
She did n't talk for about five minutes when I got her .

“ I 'm just so scared .
I do n't even want her to go to school now . "

A prayer service was held at the church Wednesday night .
