 A child is dead after a shooting that also injured three others Saturday night on the city 's Northside .

The shooting took place around 8:35 p.m. at a home on the 3900 block of Graceland Avenue , where a memorial service for an elderly woman was underway , according to Officer Rafael Diaz , a spokesman for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department .

The child who died was 10-year - old DeShaun Swanson .
The other three victims , one of which also was a juvenile , sustained injuries to their limbs and are stable , Diaz said .
He said three were transported to Riley Hospital for Children , including the victim who died , and the other was taken to Eskenazi Health .
All of the victims were male , he said .

Police said Sunday that the three victims still in the hospital are expected to survive .

About a dozen family and friends of the victims gathered at the scene Saturday night .
IMPD chaplains and members of the Ten Point Coalition prayed with some of them as police interviewed witnesses and scoured the scene for evidence .

" This is unbelievable .
My heart hurts so bad , " said Elaine Ball , a family friend .

Warner Berry Jr. , a relative of two of the victims , said the family was already grieving the loss of his mother , Zelma Hutchins , who had died two days earlier .

" Now there 's going to be more mourning , " he said .

Berry said the second juvenile victim , his great - nephew , was 16 .

Diaz said several shots from several calibers were fired outside the home .
When police arrived at the house , the victims were inside the home , but police believe they were outside when the shooting occurred , he said .

" There 's been several mentions of a vehicle that drove by and there 's been some other conflicting information , " he said .
" Those details are still being investigated . "

The same home was the subject of an undercover investigation in February , Diaz said , but he could n't say whether this shooting was connected .
He said detectives do not think this was a random act .

" It 's obviously a very sad situation , " he said .
" There 's no need for this type of violence to go on on our streets , especially when our kids are safely inside their home enjoying time with family . "

He said no suspect information was available .

Harrison of the Ten Point Coalition said the violence needs to stop .

" Something is going on in this neighborhood , " he said .
" We 've got to get a handle on what 's going on in this neighborhood . "
