Mother , Her Boyfriend Arrested After 2 Children Shot with BB Gun
A mother and her significant other were arrested by Lubbock Police on Saturday after an 11-month - old child was shot in the head with a BB gun .

A police report said Ashley Rosalyn Decastro , 23 , of Lubbock was charged with child endangerment and failure to report a felony .
The report said Adrian Garcia - Guevara , 28 , of Lubbock was arrested for injury to a child , false report and several other charges .

Decastro brought the child to University Medical Center .
UMC called police to let officers know that a BB pellet was removed from the back of the child ’s head .

The police report said Decastro claimed to live in California and the family was passing through Lubbock .
Jail records indicated Decastro lives in Lubbock .

The police report said Decastro told police that other children accidentally shot the 11-month - old .
Police didn’t believe her and told her so .

The report said Decastro changed her story .
She claimed the child stepped in front of Garcia - Guevara while the BB gun was fired and it was an accidental shooting .
Then Decastro claimed Garcia - Guevara accidentally shot the child inside the kitchen of a home in the 300 block of Waco .
Again , police didn’t believe her .

Police eventually came to believe that Garcia - Guevara shot the child with a BB gun .

The second child needed surgery to remove the BB according to the police report .

A third child was not shot with a BB gun .
However , the two older children suffered extensive bruising according to the report .
