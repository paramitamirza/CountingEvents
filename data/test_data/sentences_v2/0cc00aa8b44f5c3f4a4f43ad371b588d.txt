 Eastpointe — Friends and family decked in white for unity said their final farewells to two - year - old Makanzee Selena Oldham on Saturday as her body was taken from a church in a red carriage pulled by two horses .

The funeral brought tears and memories of Makanzee 's short life , but it looked forward to a day when her death would be brought to justice and when the mourners would reunite with Makanzee .

“ It 's hard on this side to understand that at two years old , she 's home and in the Lord 's arms , " said Pastor Kevin Lancaster , of the Love Life Family Christian Center in Eastpointe .

Makanzee died May 27 at 5:10 p.m. at St. John Hospital days after she was shot in the head while sitting in a car after gunfire broke out outside a home on the city ’s east side .
Her father , Marcell Oldham , and two other children in the vehicle were not harmed .

Three Detroit men , Cleveland Tyvon Smelley , 30 ; Deonta Charles Bennett , 21 ; and Antoine Lamar Smelley , 32 , are charged with first - degree murder and seven counts of assault with intent to murder .

Bishop Daryl Harris spoke at the funeral on behalf of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan , Police Chief James Craig and the police department 's chaplains .

" We wanted you to know from the city of Detroit that you grieve today , and we grieve with you , " Harris said to the family .
"
The police department will work very diligently to remain with you to make sure justice is served . "

The only daughter of Marcell Oldham and Marquia Crosby , Makanzee loved to sing and dance , especially to " Let it Go " from the movie " Frozen , " according to her obituary .
She was loved by her parents , was close to her cousins , and was found frequently carrying a pink blanket she owned since birth , the obituary read .

" Life without you is nonexistent , " Crosby said in a statement in the program .
" You made me a better person , and I thank you for giving me the chance to become a great mom and loving me no matter what . "

Lancaster and other clergy urged family and friends to use the tragedy to deepen their relationship with God and work to end violence in the community .

" We have to make up our minds that this violence has to stop , " Lancaster said .
" When emotions are raised and when feelings are out of control , I 'm going to ask you : Will you see her again ? "

Makanzee was to be buried at Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Detroit .
