 A bloody Mother 's Day weekend in Detroit left seven people dead and 14 others injured in 17 shootings across the city , according to Police Chief James Craig , who said it was the second - most - violent weekend of the year .

" Again , when you talk about the recent spate of violence , especially involving children starting on Easter , that drives a lot of fear and we recognize that , " Craig said Monday at a news conference .
" That 's why the initiative , Taking Back Our Neighborhoods , one neighborhood at a time does have value .
... I 'll say it and it may infuriate some , but the city 's become desensitized to violence over the years .
...
I just know it was almost an acceptance if you will , '
Well Detroit 's going to be violent . '
I 'm suggesting that that 's not the way life should be .
We 're moving in the right direction . "

Craig said the shootings took place from Friday through Sunday , including one shooting that left one person dead and four others wounded Friday night on the city ’s east side and the fatal shooting of a man Sunday night in southwest Detroit .
Of all the shootings this weekend , only two people are in custody so far , but Craig said investigators are continuing to work on the cases .

" One of the things we are doing , it 's very clear we are fighting our own progress , " Craig said .
" I wo n't claim success as you 've heard me say .
Our overall crime is declining , but we are fighting our own progress .
When you look at this past weekend , I 've said time and time and time again , one homicide is one too many .
We have 21 victims .
... Two weekends ago , we were sitting on a total number of 24 victims , so the last three to four weeks have n't been good . "

According to police , three of the shootings this weekend happened within just an hour of each other .

The first shooting happened at 7 p.m. Friday in a neighborhood near Packard and Savage streets .
Police said two 21-year - old men were in the area when a dark - colored Dodge Stratus pulled up with at least three people inside .
Two people got out and started firing shots , fatally shooting one of the 21-year - old men .
The other man was not injured .

Forty minutes later , another shooting happened in a neighborhood in the 2000 block of Meadow .
A man was standing near the street when a vehicle pulled up , a person got out of the vehicle and tried to rob him .
The men exchanged gunfire and then a third man showed up and started firing shots as well .
He was shot , along with the man who drove up in the vehicle .
The robbery victim was not injured .
Police said on Friday , one person is in custody in that incident .

Twenty minutes later , at about 8 p.m. , five men in their mid-20s were gunned down while standing in front of a car wash on the 12300 block of Gratiot .
One man died , one is in stable condition and two were in temporary serious condition .
Police did not release the condition of the fifth man .

The fourth shooting happened at 2:15 a.m. Saturday on Schoolcraft near Grandville .
Two males , including one wearing a white mask , approached a 51-year - old male on foot and shot him .
It 's unclear whether it was a robbery , but the victim called police .
His condition was not immediately released .

Almost two hours later , at about 4 a.m. , a 45-year - old male was found dead with a gunshot wound in the street near the 7000 block of Minock .

Then Sunday , a 9-year - old boy found a handgun in a neighbor ’s yard and accidentally shot himself while showing the gun to his mother .
Williams said the shooting happened Sunday afternoon on the city ’s west side .
The boy was taken to a hospital .

As of May 9 , there have been 96 homicides in the city , Craig said , which is the same number at this time last year .

" But when you look at homicides year to date and you compare it to 2013 , we 're sitting on a 14 percent reduction , " Craig said .

Despite the bloody weekend , Craig said he believes the city is moving in the right direction .
Touting several recent initiatives , he said his department is continuing to make strides .
Project Green Light , which is an initiative that allows Detroit police to monitor some gas stations across the city through high - definition cameras , already has begun to pay off , Craig said .
Security footage taken from one of the gas station 's involved in the project led to an arrest and charges against a woman who was ID'd in a high - profile shooting in March at a Mobil gas station on the city 's west side .

Craig said a partnership with the community and its stakeholders continues to be key in fighting crime .

" I do n't like to use the word snitch when we talk about the people in our neighborhoods , " Craig said .
" I use the word cooperation and that does happen .
When we talk about no snitching , no snitching is only recognized in the criminal culture .
What we 're seeing a lot of times in these shooting incidents , it could be criminal on criminal , they 're not talking
and we do know that people know what happens . ...
So shame on you if you know something and you 're not saying anything because you 're part of the problem . "
