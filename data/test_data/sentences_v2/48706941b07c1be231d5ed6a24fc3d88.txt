MDFR battles five alarm brush fire
On April 28 , at 12:30 p.m. , Miami - Dade Fire Rescue ( MDFR ) responded to a report of a brush fire located in the area of NW 137 Avenue and 17 Street .

Winds were blowing at about 16 mph from the southeast causing the fire to spread to the northwest .
Several minutes into combating the blaze , a second alarm was declared .
This strategy doubled the amount of responding units initially dispatched .

No homes were threatened and the nearby jail , Metro West , was not in jeopardy at the time .
Firefighters continued to battle the flames in an effort to keep the fire from spreading .
MDFR soon joined forces with the Florida Division of Forestry .

At approximately 5:00 p.m. , the winds changed in direction and began to blow toward the northeast causing the fire to grow in the same direction .
The change of the fire ’s course now threatened the Metro West Detention Center .
This new danger tasked the Miami - Dade Corrections Department with evacuating more than 2,000 inmates from the facility .
At 6:00 p.m. , a fifth alarm was declared .
By this time , Air Rescues North and South had performed several water drops over the main portion of the fire .
Both helicopters were instrumental in keeping the fire from growing and keeping it in check .

Fortunately , as night fell , the winds died down significantly .
By 8:00 p.m. , the fire was declared under control .
Though some fire crews remained on scene to keep watch for any flare - ups , most units were released by 10 p.m..
 More than 120 firefighters aggressively fought this blaze and prevented it from reaching the detention center in the fire ’s path .
No injuries were reported .
