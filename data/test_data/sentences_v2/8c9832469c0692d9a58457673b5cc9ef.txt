 Investigators say Watford was trying to surprise the woman , as she was on the phone with Watford at the time of the shooting .

She heard noises in the house and grabbed her gun , fearing that there was an intruder in the home .
She told investigators that she saw a shadow in the hallway and fired one shot .

By 8:00 a.m. the scene appeared to have been cleaned up and there did not appear to be any further police activity .

Officials say that the death appears to be accidental .

The fatal shooting occurred about a block away from Hamilton High West , and children were seen walking to school in the otherwise quiet neighborhood .

This marks the fourth homicide in the township this year .
