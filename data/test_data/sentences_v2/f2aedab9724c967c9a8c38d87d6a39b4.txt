10PM : Salt Lake man shoots 8-year - old boy , then himself in murder - suicide , police say
 SALT LAKE CITY â€”
Police say a Salt Lake man shot an 8-year - old boy and then himself in a murder - suicide Tuesday inside a Capitol Hill apartment .

Officers were called to a report of a domestic incident involving a gun just after noon at an apartment at 561 N. Center .
Salt Lake police detective Greg Wilking said the weapon used in the killings was an " improvised firearm " rather than a traditional gun , though he declined to elaborate further about the device or the fatal injuries sustained by the man and the boy .

The device used traditional bullets , according to police .

" The scene is going to take a long time to process due to the complexity of it , " Wilking said Tuesday .

The 911 call was made by the boy 's mother , Wilking said .
When officers arrived inside the apartment , they found the man deceased , the child injured and the boy 's mother , who was not injured .

The boy was transported to Primary Children 's Hospital , where he was later pronounced dead , Wilking said .

Investigators believe the boy , his mother and the man lived at the apartment together .
None of their names were released Tuesday .

The motive for the murder - suicide was unknown Tuesday , Wilking said , noting that police do not believe there are any outstanding suspects .

Shelby Castleton , a neighbor , said she was flabbergasted to hear about the ordeal .
Castleton remembers the boy going to and from school .

" The bus would come up every morning and he would jump in and then come home , and then I could always hear him yelling for his mom , " she said .

Nothing about the home itself made Castleton suspicious that something was wrong there , she said .

" Any glimpses I got inside their apartment , they always had drawings of his up , " Castleton said of the boy .

She added that the man who lived at the apartment was a " great guy as far as I knew . "
 "
He was so nice with me always , " Castleton said .
