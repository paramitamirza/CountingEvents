 MANHATTAN —
A father was killed and four other people were injured in what police believe was a gang - related " vendetta " shooting .

Shadale Graham , a 28-year - old father of a 7-year - old boy , had just left the 137 Bar and Grill , at 3379 Broadway , along with two men and two women about 11:15 p.m. when he had a brief argument with two men and walked away , an NYPD spokesman said .

The shooting may have been sparked by a gang - related fight , according to city Councilman Mark Levine , who represents the area .

Last night 's shooting on 137th & Broadway , leaving 1 dead and 4 injured , appears to be gang - related vendetta .
Video of suspects coming soon .

The councilman said that police have identified the suspects , who have extensive criminal records .

But Graham 's mother , Yvonne Graham , 51 , disputed her son 's gang membership .
 "
He is not in a gang .
They are n't in a gang .
They 're too old to be in a gang .
He has n't ever been in a gang , " the grieving mother said .

" I wish they 'd stop saying that , " she added .

Graham and his friends were coming from the bar when they stopped to flirt with three women standing in front of the Crown Fried Chicken near the shooting scene , a source said .

Graham and the group , none of whose names were released , walked south and made it to a deli at 3345 Broadway when the two men came up from behind and opened fire , police said .

" I heard like five , ' Bang , bam , bam , bam . '
There were some customers in front .
They started screaming , ' Oh my God !
Oh my God ! ' and I came up to the front , " said deli worker Francisco Basquis , 33 .

" I saw a man on the sidewalk .
There was blood coming out of his head , " Basquis said .

Graham , of Central Harlem , was shot in the head and pronounced dead at the scene , NYPD officials said .

A 24-year - old man was hit in the right arm and ankle and was treated at Harlem Hospital along with a 22-year - old man who was hit in the torso and leg , police said .

The women they were with , two 21-year - olds , were both hit in the shoulder and treated at St. Luke 's Hospital , police said .

They were all listed in stable condition , officials said .

" It was certainly a targeted shooting .
they were looking for these guys . "
Levine , who spoke to the precinct commander , said .
" The two women were innocent bystanders , caught in the cross fire . "

The two shooters hopped into a nearby cab and fled the scene , police said .

They had not been arrested as of Monday morning , police said .

" The polices are treating it as like a vendetta shooting , " the councilman said .

Graham 's family and friends gathered at his home in Harlem to console his grieving mother .

" Everybody 's crying and weeping and sharing stories , " Yvonne Graham said .

Now , she has to take on the difficult task of burying her son , made harder without adequate financing .

" I don’t have money right now .
I don’t have insurance , " the 51-year - old said .

Her son , who 's survived by his own 7-year - old boy , two brothers and two sisters , liked to have a good time with friends and relax at home , she said .

" He was a fun - loving , caring father , " his distraught mother said .
