“ I am angry because people are walking around with guns .
All kinds of people on the street have guns ”

Taya ( Wilta ) Wordsworth , 15 , was fatally shot in the head when she stayed home from school Friday in Far Rockaway .

, officials said .

Wilta , who also went by the nickname Taya , skipped school Friday to avoid a fight , Skrine said .
Wilta ’s mother was at work , so she decided to invite two boys , both 15 , over , according to Nia .

“ She let them in , ”
Nia said .
“ ( Wilta and the shooter ) were play fighting and he just pulled it out and he shot her .
“ I could n't believe it , ” Nia added .
“ I kept touching her and she would n't wake up .
Nia , still dressed only in her undergarments from the sleepover , ran out of the apartment and began pounding on neighbors’ doors for help .

She came to ask to use my phone to call the police , ” said building super German Tejata .

didn’t mean to .

Tejata raced up to the apartment and found Wilta unconscious in her bedroom .

She was halfway in bed and on the floor , ” he said .

The doomed teen died at St. John ’s Hospital early Saturday , police said .

Surveillance footage showed one of the boy ’s fleeing in the moments after the shooting , according to the super .

 “
I don’t want anything bad to happen to them but they’re gonna have to suffer the consequences .
Wilta , who attended nearby Middle School 53 , had just moved into the building over the summer , neighbors said .
 “
She didn’t deserve it , ”
Nia said .
" That was my best friend .
That was like my sister .
Teague knew that her daughter had a sleepover and was skipping school on Friday .

Teague said she immigrated from Liberia to the U.S. in 1999 so Wilta — and later Wilta ’s 7-year - old brother Maxwell could be born American citizens .

The proud mom hoped Wilta would have a better life than she did , she said .

" They took away my American dream , " she cried .
