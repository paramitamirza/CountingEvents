3 teens , believed targeted , older man all shot outside SW Philly bar
A 63-year - old man who was one of four people shot and wounded Friday night outside a bar in the Kingsessing section of Southwest Philadelphia was not an intended target and was just having a smoke when he was hit by two stray bullets , a police lieutenant said Saturday .

One of the bullets entered the man 's left side and lodged in his stomach , and the other hit him in the neck , Lt .
John Walker of the Southwest Detective Division said .

Three teenagers who were shot and wounded are believed to have been the intended targets , Walker said .

The shooting occurred in front of Wanda 's Lounge on the 5500 block of Springfield Avenue at about 9:20 p.m. Friday .
Walker said police did not have any suspects and the shooting was not caught on surveillance video .

When police arrived outside the bar , they found the older man and a 17-year - old boy shot and wounded , Walker said .
Police took both victims to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in critical condition .
The teen was hit by a bullet that entered his shoulder area , went across his back and through his spinal cord , Walker said .

Walker said the two other shooting victims - both 18-year - old males - were taken to hospitals in private vehicles .

One , who was shot in the left foot , was taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania , where he was treated and released .

He told police he had been outside Wanda 's with two of his friends - the other teenage shooting victims - when he heard gunshots , took off running , then realized he was shot in the foot , police said .
He said he stopped an unknown person , who drove him to HUP.

The other 18-year - old , who was shot in his left arm and foot , was taken to Penn Presbyterian by a man he knew in the neighborhood .
He was listed in stable condition Saturday .

The driver who took him to Penn Presbyterian had a gun in his vehicle and immediately told police he had one , Walker said .
Police determined this man has a permit to carry a gun , which was not used in the shooting , Walker said .
The man was released after being questioned by police .

Twelve shell casings from two guns were found at the scene .

Walker said it was n't yet clear who was firing guns outside Wanda 's on Friday night , and police were not aware of the motive behind the shooting .
