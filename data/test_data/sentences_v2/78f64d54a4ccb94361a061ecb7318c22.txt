Harmon , a steadfast defender of gun rights and a champion of conservative viewpoints , was a longtime editor and columnist for the Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram .
He worked for the newspaper for 41 years , and continued to write a weekly column after he retired in 2011 .

The teenage boy and his father , both from North Berwick , were visiting Harmon ’s home at the time of the shooting , police said .
They have been cooperating with the investigation and detectives were expected to question them again Thursday .

Their names are not being released because the shooting is still under investigation , state police spokesman Steve McCausland said Thursday night .
 “
The circumstances under which the gun was introduced is still under investigation , ” said McCausland , who did not know why the gun was loaded .
It is just one of the many questions we have .
He declined to release further details Thursday .
An autopsy of Harmon ’s body will be done at the state Medical Examiner ’s Office , and the case will be reviewed by the state Attorney General ’s Office .
The results of the autopsy were not available Thursday night .

Harmon ’s wife , Margaret Harmon , declined Thursday to discuss details of the shooting , calling it an “ accidental tragedy .
”
 Police have not described the type of handgun involved .

CONSERVATIVE , GUN - RIGHTS DEFENDER
 Harmon graduated from high school in Pennsylvania before attending Bowdoin College in Brunswick , where he graduated cum laude in 1967 .
He served in the Army from 1967 to 1969 , including a stint in Vietnam , and in the Army Reserves from 1970 to 1975 .

Harmon started his career at the Evening Express and the Press Herald in 1970 , working as a reporter before becoming city editor , managing editor and then an editorial writer .
In retirement , he continued to write his weekly column and take on freelance assignments .

Harmon was known as a conservative thinker and a staunch defender of gun rights in his newspaper columns , including some that argued against the recent failed referendum to require background checks for private gun purchases .

In a Sept. 13 , 1993 , editorial column , Harmon wrote about the importance of everyone ’s constitutional right to own a firearm .

“ I view threats to that freedom as seriously as I do threats to my right to vote , or speak freely , or worship as I please , ” he wrote .

In that same column , Harmon wrote that he had belonged to the National Rifle Association from the day of his first paycheck .
