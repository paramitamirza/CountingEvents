The handgun was stolen .

It made its way into the hands of a group of teens after being stolen from a security guard 's vehicle .

On a rainy Friday afternoon in mid - July , the teens were playing with the same gun at a Tess Circle townhouse , court records say , when a single shot rang out .
It struck Travon Rollins in the chest , killing him .

Now his cousin , 15-year - old Cartrez Harvey , is being charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm by a delinquent .

When police arrived at the Chesapeake Place apartments , blood was on the stoop of the home and in the street .
Rollins , a 16-year - old upcoming junior at Rickards High School , had fallen several times on his way out of the home where he lived with his mother .

A crowd had gathered .
A short distance away , people wailed as the news of Rollins’ death spread .

Before first responders arrived , several teens loaded Rollins into a car and headed for the hospital , neighbors said the day after the shooting .

Stephen Hardy , a neighbor whose son played basketball in the neighborhood with Rollins , helped load the teen into a car .
The driver tried to rush Rollins to the hospital but was told by 911 dispatchers to turn around and return to the scene .
First responders rushing Rollins to the hospital did not feel he would survive .

Hardy described the moments after the shooting as a panic .
 “
That was everybody ’s main concern that the boy get off to the hospital , ” Hardy said the day after the shooting .
“
They were kids .
They didn’t know what to do .
They panicked .
They were like what do we do , what do we do ? ”

At first , Harvey told investigators he and several other teens were playing with three guns , a handgun , carbine and a rifle , in Rollins’ upstairs bedroom .

He said Rollins was pointing the gun at him and they tussled over it when the gun went off .

But his story changed several times during a police interview .

Police left Harvey in the interview room with his mother who continued to press him about what happened .
Court records say Harvey told her he had been in possession of the gun , not Rollins , when it went off .
He vacillated about what to tell investigators .
At one point , he asked his grandmother whether he should keep lying .

She told him to tell the truth .

Police did not find the handgun that shot Rollins at the home .
Instead , they found it in the wood line on Dian Court , a dead end road a half - mile away .

Harvey eventually told police he and another man had driven to Dian Court to throw the gun into the woods where Tallahassee Police found it .
Harvey told police the weapons were stolen .

When pressed about discrepancies in his story , he told investigators he had his own gun at the home .
He thought it was empty , but it went off when someone bumped into him .
He said he did n't pull the trigger .

His story had changed , he said , because others were telling him what to say and he followed their advice .

At the time of the shooting , Harvey , who is being charged as an adult , was on probation for charges of fleeing or eluding police and resisting arrest .

He is being held at the Leon County Jail on $ 25,000 bond .
