16-year - old nearly killed , possibly over a pair of shoes
INDIANAPOLIS , Ind ( WTHR ) -
A teen was nearly killed in a Friday night shooting , and investigators think it was all because of shoes .

Officers found the 16-year - old victim in the 5700 block of Port Lillian Dr. around 7:15 p.m. with at least one gunshot wound .
He was taken to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition .

" He ’s like one of the highest students in his class .
He always has good grades , " Anna Sanchez , the victim 's aunt , said .

Residents heard seven or eight gunshots , at least some of which were targeted at Sanchez 's nephew .
One of his buddies banged on Charles Depp 's front door to tell him what happened and ask for help .

" He was trying to sell some shoes , and the guy [ they were going to sell to ] started shooting at him , " Depp said the teens told him .

Police say the victim was playing soccer with a nephew and some friends when two young men walked out of the nearby woods , showed pistols and " words were exchanged " over that pair of tennis shoes .

" We don’t know of there was a disagreement over them , if that is what precipitated the result of one of the black males firing shots striking our Hispanic victim , " said IMPD Deputy Chief Val Cunningham .

He was shot in the abdomen .
His rescuers did their best to stabilize him , but he was still listed in critical condition when he arrived at the hospital .

The suspects ran back to the woods , one wearing a red bandana and the other in a gray sweatshirt .

Relatives say the 16-year - old has been looking for a job , trying to help out his single mom .
