 Tuesday 's hearing focused primarily on the brother of James Poore 's girlfriend , DeAndre Jones , who sat on the stand for four hours .
Jones , who said James Poore lived with him and his sister at Fairmont Terrace , testified seeing the Poores with guns on New Year 's Eve and overheard them talking about a future robbery the day of the murders .
