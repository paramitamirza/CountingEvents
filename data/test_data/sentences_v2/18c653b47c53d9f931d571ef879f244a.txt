3 year old who accidentally shot himself found gun under couch
( 05/09/16 ) - A Mid - Michigan father is facing criminal charges after his 3-year - son shot himself .

Prosecutors tell us the father was using the gun as a flashlight and did n't put it away .

Twenty - three - year - old Josh Dikowski faces child abuse and careless discharge charges after his son was shot .

The incident happened at a home in the Kerswill Lake area of Gladwin County .
According to the police report , Dikowski told police the night before the shooting , he went to check his mail using the flashlight mounted on his 9 millimeter semi - automatic handgun .

“
I would n't guess that is not standard protocol throughout Gladwin County , ” said Sheriff Mike Shea .

Shea says when Dikowski went back into the home , he placed the gun under a couch , thinking his son would n't be able to find the weapon .
Dikowski told investigators he does have a gun safe where the handgun is usually kept .
 “
The idea that you can actually put it somewhere loaded , where it ’s safe , not when there is a child in the house , there is no place safe , ”
Shea said .

The next day , Dikowski fell asleep watching cartoons with his son .
A loud pop woke him up and he noticed his son 's left arm had a bullet wound and immediately drove him to the hospital .

Dikowski would n't comment on the charges , but says his son is doing fine .

Shea says anyone purchasing a firearm should look into buying gun safety products , like safes and trigger locks .
Before bringing a gun into a home , they should think about three things .
 “
Safety , safety , safety , ”
Shea said .
“ There is a lot of different things out there on the market that can keep these weapons safe , especially when it comes to younger children .
”
 Dikowski is free on a $ 2,500 bond and his bond conditions state he can not have any firearms in the house while he cares for his son .
