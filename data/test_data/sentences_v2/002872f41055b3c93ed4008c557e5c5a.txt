 Breidenich said the child was taken to a local hospital and was being treated with a non life - threatening injury .

Police did not release the identity of the woman and said the case is under investigation .

A recent Washington Post report said , just in 2015 , people are getting shot by toddlers on a weekly basis .

The report said there have been 13 toddler shooting deaths this year , with 18 more injuring themselves , 10 injuring others and 2 killing others .

These incidents have made American children nine times more likely to die in gun accidents than children anywhere else in the developed world .

Readers reacted strongly to the story Friday out of Troy , many frustrated at the accident .

Georgeanne Seeterlin - Kittridge said : “ This is crazy .
Adults please lock your guns around children or don’t have them .
”

Mike Hall said : “ To carry a gun takes great responsibility , moreso when kids are around .
I hope she loses her CPL. ”
