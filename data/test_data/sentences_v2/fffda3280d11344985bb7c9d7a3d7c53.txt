 CHICAGO ( CBS ) — Five children –
ages 11 to 15 – were shot Sunday night in a drive - by on the South Side .

The kids were walking from a nearby park to a convenience store , when they were shot in the 6600 block of South Michigan Avenue around 7:30 p.m. , police said .

An 11-year - old girl and a 15-year - old girl were taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County .
The younger girl was the most seriously injured , initially listed in serious to critical condition , but was awake and talking Monday morning .

Her cousin , 14-year - old Jamanta White , and a 14-year - old girl , were taken to Comer Children ’s Hospital .
The girl was in serious condition , with a gunshot wound to the abdomen .

Jamanta was released from the hospital at around 10 a.m. Monday , after doctors treated him for a gunshot wound to the leg and a graze wound to his side .

A fifth child , a 14-year - old girl , walked into St. Bernard Hospital and Health Care Center after the shooting .
She had been grazed by a bullet .

Jamanta said he and his cousin were with about seven other kids who were leaving a nearby park , and were on their way to a local convenience store when a car with four young men inside pulled up and asked what gang the kids were with .

They never gave us a chance to speak , ” he said .
“ They just started shooting .
”

He said three people in the vehicle all had guns and opened fire .
He said he and his friends tried to run for cover .

I had no reason to get shot , because I’m not in a gang or nothing , ” he said .

His grandmother , Rebecca Washington , said Jamanta and his cousin attended Easter church service earlier in the day .

Easter Sunday was a typical Sunday , ” she said .

”
