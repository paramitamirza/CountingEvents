A Ford City man likely will serve probation for leaving a loaded handgun on his kitchen counter that led to his 6-year - old son being wounded .

An Armstrong County judge on Thursday accepted a guilty plea from Christopher Bryan McNeely , 30 , to a single charge of recklessly endangering another person .

The plea is part of a deal reached with prosecutors that allows McNeely to avoid jail time .
He could have been sentenced up to two years in prison , fined $ 5,000 or both .

The charge stems from an incident last August in which McNeely left two handguns on his kitchen counter before going to bed .

According to court records , McNeely 's son , Issac Deemer , and his 9-year - old half - brother awoke on Aug. 5 and found the guns .
Issac was shot once in the chest while his half - brother was playing with one of the guns .

The boy survived but was left with serious damage to his left arm .

In exchange for McNeely 's guilty plea , prosecutors withdrew more serious charges of child endangerment and allowing a minor access to a firearm — both felonies .

McNeely had been scheduled to face trial on all three charges beginning Monday .

Armstrong County District Attorney Scott Andreassi said McNeely does n't have a criminal record , he understood what he did wrong , and he is cooperating with the county children and youth services office .

McNeely 's attorney Timothy Kidd cited his continued cooperation to Judge Kenneth Valasek .
He said McNeely wants to get the case behind him and “ understands it was real bad judgment to leave a firearm unattended .
”

In a phone interview after the hearing , Julie Deemer , McNeely 's ex - wife and Isaac 's mother , acknowledged that McNeely did n't have a previous record .
Still , she wants some punishment rendered .

Probation “ seems kind of light , ” she told the Tribune - Review .

Deemer said Isaac can move his arm and elbow .
He can move his wrist only a bit , and can not use his fingers .

After the hearing , Andreassi replied that he , too , wanted more punishment in the case but was persuaded to accept a “ fair ” plea bargain .

“
McNeely will have a record , he must complete probation for 12 months , and he must cooperate with CYS,“ Andreassi said .

McNeely 's wife , Crista McNeely , who was at in the Ford City home when the shooting happened , is scheduled for trial June 6 on a single count of child endangerment .

Repeated attempts to reach her attorney , Randall H. McKinney , were n't successful .

McNeely is expected to be formally sentenced July 26 .
