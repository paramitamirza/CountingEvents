A 14-year - old was killed Wednesday in Calaveras County after another teenager accidentally shot him , according to deputies .
Family members identified the boy as Colby Fouch of West Point .

“
Everybody loved Colby , ” Mason Fouch , Colby ’s adoptive brother said .

Mason Fouch sayid he ran to his brother ’s side when he heard he had been shot .
But when he saw him , he says he knew Colby wouldn’t make it .

“ I already knew then .
Seeing the hole in his throat , I knew it for a fact , ” Mason said .

He said the 16-year - old who shot his brother was his friend and that the two boys were hanging out in a piece of land close to Colby ’s house .

Although , the sheriff 's department said they were told the boys were bird hunting .

“ Where the hunting comes in , it says reportedly , it ’s an alleged reported hunting accident , ” Sgt .

“
All the aspects and the motive and the relationship between the two , that ’s all currently being investigated .

”

The 16-year - old who pulled the trigger was arrested for negligence when shooting the firearm .
