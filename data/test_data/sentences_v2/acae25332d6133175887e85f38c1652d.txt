 Relatives originally identified the man as David Hopper , and said the girl was his niece .

The girl was identified as Zariah Muhammad by the Tribune .
Zariah and her uncle were having a water balloon fight with family members when a man spoke to her uncle before shooting at him , according to the Tribune .

Zariah , whose father was paralyzed by gunfire five years ago , was supposed to have surgery on Friday , according to the Tribune .

She was grazed in her head , said Officer Laura Amezaga , a Chicago Police spokeswoman .
Jeff Lyle , deputy district chief with the Chicago Fire Department , said she was taken to Comer Children 's Hospital , where she was listed as " stable . "

While many neighbors said the block was relatively quiet and did n't attract much criminal activity , Melvin Jones saw things differently .

" I do n't go around no corners , I do n't talk to people .
I just stay at my place and hope none of this s--- finds me , " said Jones , who lives around the corner in the 300 block of East 68th Street .
" It 's f---ed up around here .
We ca n't go to no suburbs , we 're in the middle of it .
We live in it , we sleep in it . "

" I wish [ the police ] would just send some cars to sit up on this block and keep watch , " he added , saying that his nephew had been shot to death earlier this year .

It has been a particularly brutal summer for Chicago 's children .
