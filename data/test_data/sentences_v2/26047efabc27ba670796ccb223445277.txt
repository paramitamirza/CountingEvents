FITCHBURG -- A city teenager was arrested in late February in connection with what a police spokesman said was an " accidental " shooting that left another teenager with a minor gunshot wound on Wednesday , Feb. 17 .

Carlos Lago , 18 , of 76 Leighton St. , was charged on Feb. 26 with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon , discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling and carrying a firearm without an FID card as a result of the shooting that occurred on Beech Street , said police Capt .
Steven Giannini .

He said Lago accidentally shot the victim , a 16-year - old boy , at 31 Beech St. at about 1:30 p.m. with a rifle that was recovered by police .

The teenager , said Giannini , was released from a local hospital after being treated for the minor wound .

" They were just hanging out and handling the weapon " when it went off , said Giannini , who added that police believe the age and condition of the rifle may have contributed to it going off .

In addition to Lago being arrested , Rodolfo Mercado , 22 , who lives at 31 Beech St. , was cited for the felonious misleading of a police investigation .

Giannini said Mercado was not arrested but has been summonsed to court to hear the single charge .
