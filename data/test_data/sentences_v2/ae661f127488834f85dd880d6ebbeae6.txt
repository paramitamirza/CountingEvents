Parents charged after boy , 6 , shoots brother , 9 ,
The gun a 6-year - old Milwaukee boy used to shoot his 9-year - old Milwaukee brother last week was owned by the boy 's father , a felon , and kept in a home that had no lockbox or gun safe , a criminal complaint filed Friday said .

Dominique Phillips , 39 , faces more than 10 years in prison and up to $ 35,000 in fines if convicted of the charges laid out in the complaint .
The boys ' mother faces up to nine months in prison and up to $ 10,000 in fines .

The wounded boy , identified in the charging document as " J.D.C , " was shot by his brother , " D.D.P. " on Wednesday inside their home on the 2700 block of North 20th Street after the younger boy found the Kel - Tec 9mm on top of a kitchen cabinet .

The younger boy told police that he used a chair to climb the cabinet in the kitchen and found the gun , the complaint said .
As he was holding the gun , his older brother placed his hands on his brother 's hands and the gun went off .

The bullet hit J.D.C. in the neck and exited his back near the left shoulder blade , the complaint said .

When first questioned , the boys ' mother , Nicole Jackson , said the gun was hers and that she 'd moved it from the bedroom to the kitchen earlier that day because she was cleaning the bedroom .
She later admitted the weapon belonged to Phillips .

Phillips in 2009 was convicted on felony drug charges and is not legally permitted to own a gun , court records show .
