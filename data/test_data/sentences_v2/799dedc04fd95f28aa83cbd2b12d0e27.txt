NEW ORLEANS --
A jury found 22-year - old Trung Le guilty of manslaughter in connection with a 2014 shooting on Bourbon Street that left one person dead and nine others injured .

The jury deliberated for fewer than two hours Friday night before returning the verdict .
Le was also found guilty of attempted second - degree murder .

The July 29 , 2014 , shooting took the life of Brittany Thomas and left several others with wounds they still cope with today .

Brittany Thomas ' mother was present at the courtroom and was teary - eyed when she spoke to WWL - TV reporter Tania Dall .
She said she 's glad to " see justice for Brittany . "

Brittany Thomas ' mother spoke to Tania Dall after the verdict was released in the trial of Trung Le .

Amy Mathews , a tourist visiting from Australia who was shot in the face , said she was also grateful .

In a statement , New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said that he was satisfied with the verdict .
 "
" Justice has been served , " read the statement . "
Trung Le ’s
callous and careless actions left 21-year old Brittany Thomas brutally murdered and nine others seriously injured .
This is a terrible tragedy , and it is unacceptable .
Today ’s verdict sends a clear and resounding message about accountability to the community – if you engage in violence
, you will be prosecuted , sentenced and punished . "

The defense for Le , the lone man facing charges for the shooting , rested without calling a single witness .
However , Le 's attorney , Martin Regan , offered a closing argument that lasted nearly 2 hours and 45 minutes .

Prosecutors said Le fired the first four shots at an unknown second gunman .
But Le 's defense attorney said that flight alone does not prove guilt , and that Le fled to Mississippi , where he was arrested , to get money from relatives for a lawyer .

Prosecutor Tiffany Tucker said , " You are responsible for every bullet that leaves your gun . "
She also said Le had " taken no responsibility , has offered no apologies " for his actions that day .

Le 's sentencing is set for Feb. 18 .
