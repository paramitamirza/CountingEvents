7 wounded in Eureka Garden attack ; about 50 rounds fired , police say
Every apartment unit in Jacksonville ’s Eureka Garden received a flier Monday asking for information about a late Sunday shooting that left seven people wounded .

The Rev. Mark Griffin , pastor of Wayman Ministries a few blocks away , held a community meeting Monday afternoon to let the residents know their safety is a top priority , and he said they were “ dismayed ” by what happened the night before .

“ Part - time security is not sufficient , ” he said , calling for ownership to hire more protection to deter any type of retaliation .

People were sitting or standing around a stairway to Unit 11 at Eureka Garden late Sunday when the gunfire began .

Gunmen opened up at 11:45 p.m. , hitting seven people outside a building at the troubled Westside apartment complex as other bullets shattered and pierced the windows of a parked sport - utility vehicle nearby , according to the Jacksonville Sheriff ’s Office .

Police said three gunmen walked up between the two apartment units across Altoona Court , just a few dozen feet off Plymouth Street at the west end of the subsidized apartment complex .
They aimed at eight or 10 people “ just hanging out ” in front of Unit 11 , leaving two in life - threatening condition , police said .

They fired numerous rounds .
It appears to be rifle rounds and from handguns , into the crowd , ” said Sgt .
Shawn Coursey , part of the Sheriff ’s Violent Crime Impact team .
There was an infant in the crowd .
Thankfully , the infant was not struck .
The gunmen fired more than 50 rounds at the people before fleeing .
Victims were taken to UF Health Jacksonville and Orange Park Medical Center , police said .

Eureka Garden resident Gail Thomas said the gunshots woke her at 11:45 p.m. Sunday and she first thought she was dreaming .
More gunshots rang out near her apartment , about five units away from the shooting scene , before her 8-year - old granddaughter finally shook her awake .
 “
She heard gunshots and she jumped on me saying , ‘
They are shooting!,’
It was like they were coming through my window , ” Thomas said .
“ Oh my Lord , I am so glad my family is safe ! ...
You have little babies out here .
Bullets don’t know anybody .
I thank God that everybody who got shot didn’t die . ”

Thomas , vice president of the Eureka Garden tenants association , said she received a lot of phone calls Monday , including one from a friend in Miami who saw the shooting on the news and worried about her .

Eureka Garden is a federally subsidized apartment complex just west of Cassat Avenue , owned by Global Ministries Foundation of Memphis , Tenn.
The Rev. Richard Hamlet , President and CEO of Global Ministries , issued a statement about the shooting late Monday morning .
He said their hearts go out to those who were injured “ by the brazen actions of the criminals who appeared during the night at Eureka and terrorized the families living there .
”
He said they are working with the Sheriff ’s Office to help identify the gunmen and bring them to justice swiftly .

Eureka has had its share of criminal problems in recent years .

On Nov. 14 , 2015 , a Jacksonville man was shot in the leg in the complex , only days after a major leak saw gas service to all 400 units cut off .

A year earlier , Altone Finney was shot and killed after he kicked in the door at another apartment there and charged the resident , who was there with his wife , a 6-week - old child and an adult friend , the Sheriff ’s Office said .
The homeowner was cleared of any wrongdoing in the apparent home invasion , police said .
On Oct. 27 , 2014 , Demantrae Franklin , 15 , was found fatally shot in the back shortly after 10 p.m.
That was the last major shooting reported at the complex until Sunday ’s .

Meanwhile , federal , state and local officials also have focused on Eureka Garden for nearly a year since inspectors uncovered hundreds of violations in 340 of the 400 apartments .
Those problems ranged from mold and rotting stairways to damaged refrigerators and stoves .

After Global Ministries did repairs , the complex passed a federal inspection earlier this year with a score of 62 , two points above passing .

Inspectors still found problems .

When Mayor Lenny Curry and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio toured Eureka Garden in May , the latter called Global Ministries a slumlord and said the company operating as a nonprofit is a sham .
He also called for a federal investigation into the Tennessee - based owner .
On Aug. 3 , U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department agents raided Global Ministries Foundation ’s Tennessee headquarters .
The nonprofit group owns Eureka Garden and five other apartment complexes in Jacksonville .

City Councilman Garrett Dennis , whose district includes Eureka Garden , said he was shocked when he learned of the shooting since Eureka Garden has come a long way in recent years .
He said he does not want this to define the complex , and added that Sheriff Mike Williams told him that the shooting was a “ targeted act .
”
 “
This wasn’t a random act , ”
Dennis said .
It was a targeted act , but I think what happened with Eureka –
it is not just a picture of Eureka .
It is a picture of what is happening across Jacksonville .
…
I don’t think it ’s isolated .
It ’s a picture of the city as a whole .
Dennis sent U.S. Housing and Urban Development administrators an email , saying “ it is imperative that HUD make their presence known in person to the Eureka Gardens Community as soon as possible .
 “
With the lack of security at the complex and ownership questions , the residents need some answers from HUD , ” the letter continued .
With the pending sale , it is apparent that the current owners are doing the bare minimum and this is again , at the expense of the residents .
Many residents as well as neighbors showed up Monday morning , worried about what happened .

Shayla Grant , pushing her son Gerald , 3 , in a stroller , stopped by to check on a cousin who lived in the cluster of apartments that were under fire .
Another woman reached Grant ’s cousin while she watched police work the crime scene .

Grant lives on the other side of the large complex and did not hear any shots , but she increasingly has grown worried during her two years living there .
They already had difficult living conditions .
Now , with the violence and worries about the safety of her and her son , she wants to move .

I just want to know what they’re going to do to make us feel safe , ” she said .
“ … We live here , pay rent and don’t feel safe .
I just want to feel secure and safe .
Bullets flying around could have hit anybody .
It ’s not the residents .
It ’s the people who come into our community and walk around like they live here .
Another man who would only identify himself as Doug said he rushed to the complex Monday morning after hearing about the shooting because his grandchildren live there .
He said his grandson is always talking about what ’s happening at this complex .

He doesn’t want anything to happen to his mama and his little brothers .
He ’s 5 years old and he ’s smart and he sees all this stuff and he doesn’t like it , ” the man said .
“ ...
It ’s a little crazier .
They are supposed to have 24-hour security around here .
They didn’t have any 24-hour security .
If they had that , this wouldn’t have happened .
Eureka Garden tenant association president Tracy Grant had already went to work early Monday morning when the full news of the shooting reached her .
She said this is the first serious shooting incident at Eureka Garden since the teen ’s death almost two years ago .
She said she is stunned .
“ I don’t really know what else to say ” about Sunday ’s mass shooting .
Grant said she would like to see security beefed up .

Griffin said he began walking around the complex and talking to residents as soon as he heard about the shooting .
He said he ’s frustrated by what happened Sunday night , and all the residents he ’s spoken to are very distraught .

They have worked so hard to keep these kind of things from happening , ” he said .
It ’s been almost two years since the last homicide was committed over here .
I wanted to reassure the residents that their hard work is not in vain .
Griffin said the need for more constant security has been a long - running tenant complaint .
He said the security officers are paid to keep an eye on the complex , and residents deserve a secure environment .

U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown , D - Jacksonville , wrote a letter Monday to Housing Secretary Julian Castro asking that the federal agency provide increased security .
The letter requested 24-hour surveillance and “ round the clock police security , ” at Eureka and at Washington Heights , which is also owned by Global Ministries .
She wrote that “ it has been clearly demonstrated today that the current roaming patrols are insufficient .
“ Both of these security provisions are essential and need to be included in the contract(s )
when these properties are transferred to their new owners in the near future , ” adding that secure gates and an upgrade in surveillance cameras so they could “ access all angles of the buildings ” are also needed , Brown wrote .

The congresswoman attended the Monday afternoon tenants association meeting along with Dennis and Griffin .
Brown requested a briefing as soon as she returns to Washington from Congress ’s August recess .

Hamlet ’s statement also addressed the security concerns presented by some , saying that while they do not know of any owner of Section 8 housing that has armed guards day and night , Eureka Garden has “ targeted paid security and surveillance technology ” to cover its sprawling multi - block community .

“ To support the JSO and city leaders as they tackle the high rates of violent crime in the area , GMF significantly increased security measures as soon as we purchased the property , ” the statement said .

With the Eureka property for sale and other issues including the shooting , Dennis said tenants are uncertain about their future .
This is the reason that HUD needs to come down here and address these tenants , ” he said .

Federal housing officials indicated via email to the city councilman ’s staff they will have representatives next week to meet with residents .

Dennis said next week is not soon enough .
He said residents told him at Monday ’s meeting they’ve heard retaliation is coming .
