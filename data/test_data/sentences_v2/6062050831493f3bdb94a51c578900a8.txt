 One man is in critical condition and three others are injured after an early morning shooting downtown .

According to Metro Police , officers responded at 6:19 a.m. to the 200 block of North 3rd Street , near the intersection of Ogden Avenue and 3rd Street where the Downtown Grand is , on reports of a shooting and found four adult victims — two men and two women — suffering from apparent gunshot wounds .

The four victims were taken to UMC with mostly nonlife - threatening injuries , though one man is listed in critical condition .

" They should all be OK , " Metro Lt .
Kendall Bell said .

Two men were involved in a verbal dispute on a sidewalk in the area when the four victims walked past them , Bell said .
Words were exchanged , and at some point , one of the suspects entered a white sedan and grabbed a handgun , according to Metro .

The man fired at the victims , striking them , before he and the other man involved in the initial argument got into the car and continued shooting as they drove away , a Metro news release said .

It was initially reported that the man had shot a round into the ground as well .

Judy Nitura , an employee at the Beef Jerky Store on 3rd Street , said she heard a shot this morning but was n't sure if it was a serious issue .

" I thought it was something else , " she said .
" I did n't see anybody running and nobody shouted , so I did n't think anything of it . "

The suspects are in custody .

The two men involved in the initial verbal altercation who are being sought by police are described as black male adults in their 20s .
One was wearing a long - sleeved maroon shirt and blue jeans ; the other was wearing an orange shirt and shorts .
The vehicle is described as a white , four - door sedan with dark tint and a sunroof
