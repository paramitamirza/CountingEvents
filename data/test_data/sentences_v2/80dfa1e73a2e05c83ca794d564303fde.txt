He would love to sing , but he couldn’t sing , ” Puente said , laughing .
He always had a positive energy around him .
Kimbryanna Smith , Puente ’s 17-year - old sister , said she was stunned to hear Stockard had been killed .

It was actually shocking , ” Smith said .

Smith said Stockard liked to stay in and play video games ; Dickerson said the two had played together many times .

He likes to laugh , he likes to make other people laugh , ”
Smith said .
He ’s really the joker .
It will be OK , ” Smith said .
I know he ’s in a better place . ”

 “
His memory will live on in us and everyone else whose life he filled with joy .
