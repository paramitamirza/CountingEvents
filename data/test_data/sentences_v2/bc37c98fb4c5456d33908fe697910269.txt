Shooting reported at Kimball HS
 DALLAS —
It was the end of first period at Justin F. Kimball High School in Dallas when students heard a gunshot .

" My nerves are still going , " said Liberty Pena , who was in class at the time .

Police say a student brought a small derringer to class and had it in his pocket when it accidentally went off .
Pena has several friends that were in the classroom at the time .

" They heard a pop while taking a test and they thought it was a balloon , "
Pena said .
" And all of a sudden blood started pouring on the floor and he dropped the revolver . "

The student who brought the gun was shot in the leg and transported to a local hospital with non - life - threatening injuries .
The district says the student arrived at school with the weapon for an unplanned meeting with administrators .

Students started texting and calling their parents , who rushed to the high school .

Raymond Jeffery , who has a son at the school , was among some of the parents who went up to the school .

" They are supposed to be in the safest place besides a church , " Jeffrey said .
" I do n't understand . "

Eva Alejandro got a text from her daughter .

" She said , ' Mom , I am in the gym .
I am hiding .
I 'm scared but I 'm safe , ' " Alejandro said .

Parents questioned how the gun got into the school in the first place and what the student was planning to do with it .

" I am wondering why was the gun brought to school ? " said Lashell Booker .

Dallas ISD police say the student arrived at the school with his mother .
Other students had already gone through a metal detector .
By that time , the machine had been pushed aside .
The student walked in without being screened for a weapon .

" The metal detectors are monitored differently after school starts , " said Dallas ISD Police Chief Craig Miller .
" The student in this instance came in with a parent for the meeting and it was n't observed at that point . "

Dallas ISD officials say they 'll review what happened and will make changes to its safety plan if necessary .
