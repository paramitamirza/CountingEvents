Five men shot at party near SVSU , shooter still on the loose
UPDATE : ( 09/12/16 )
- Detectives are trying to track down the man who opened fire at a college party , hitting five people .

The shooting happened early Sunday morning at an off - campus apartment complex just across the street from Saginaw Valley State University .

All five men who were shot are home recovering .

Witnesses have not been able to give the Saginaw County Sheriff 's Office a solid description of the shooter .

They are only able to describe him as a black man in his 20 's with blonde or orange tipped dreadlocks .

Detectives have gotten some tips , but nothing that has lead to his identity or arrest .

Sheriff Bill Federspiel tells ABC12 that the five men who were shot have not been as cooperative as they could be , so they 're not sure if the shooter and victims knew each other .

There were roughly 1,000 people at the party when the man started shooting .

The five men he hit were not SVSU students , nor did any of them live at the apartment complex .

Even so , the university says it 's time to revisit the safety of its students on and off campus .

The starting point will be to reach out to staff at Campus Village at Cardinal Center ; most of the people who live there are SVSU students .

" We have had ongoing conversations with the owners and the management company of that apartment complex for a number of years .
There 's going to be a renewed emphasis for not only dialogue , but some new procedures to see what we can do in this instance .
Obviously that requires their cooperation , but we are going to see if that cooperation can be achieved , " said J. J. Boem , SVSU spokesman .

Federspiel is trying to set up a meeting with his staff , the University , campus police and Campus Village management .

" There will be changes , I know there will be , " he said .

What changes are still to be discussed .

Campus Village has a private security team that was there the night of the party and they have a contract with the sheriff 's office for patrols .

" The idea is that if individuals see that there 's law enforcement there that maybe they wo n't commit crimes .
Obviously that was n't a deterrent on Sunday morning , " Federspiel said .

Federspiel understands some people question why the party was n't broken up earlier .
 " It really is n't our place to decide how big of a gathering can occur on private property .
It is our place to enforce it when a property owner says enough is enough , " he said .

Federspiel says neither apartment management nor security made that request Sunday morning .

 ( 09/11/16 ) - Five men were shot during a party at an off campus apartment complex near Saginaw Valley State University Sunday morning .

All five victims will recover .

They were treated at local hospitals and released within hours of the shooting .

None of the five victims were SVSU students .

The Saginaw County Sheriff 's Office is leading the investigation into what unfolded at Campus Village at Cardinal Center Sunday just before 2 a.m. The apartment complex sits off Pierce Road near Davis Road in Kochville Township .

Sixteen shell casings were found during the investigation .
It 's believed they are all from the same handgun .

Detectives believe the shooter is a black man in his 20 's with blonde or orange tipped dreadlocks .

The shooting victims have n't been much help .

" We 're still hoping the victims will become a little more cooperative than they have been , " said Bill Federspiel , the Saginaw County sheriff .

Federspiel says around a thousand people were at the party when the man opened fire .

" If he 's brazen enough to fire a gun and shoot five people in a crowd of a thousand with a deputy 300 yards away , we need to bring him him , " Federspiel said .

A sheriff 's deputy , contracted to work at the complex , was on property when the shots were fired .

" This shooting occurred even though we had a presence of law enforcement , which is to me , very scary .
The fact that we had uniformed patrol with a marked car on the premise , and this shooting still occurred , is very concerning to me , " Federspiel said .

Detectives do n't know a motive yet .

" Witnesses have told us that the person described as the shooter was overheard stating that he was not happy with some of the people who were at that party , " Federspiel said .

Students describe a very scary situation .

" I was just enjoying the night and then heard three gunshots and everyone just started running , " said Max Amato , a student who was at the party .

" It was all dark so all you could see was like red , like flashes when the gun goes off , " said Aaron Hegarty , an SVSU senior .

Partygoers we talked to say things were fine for most of the night , SVSU celebrating after a big football win over Northwood university .

" It was just a big party .
Everybody was invited , they had D.J. 's set up back here , everybody was dancing .
Then it got to be like
2:00 and then that 's when shots rang out , " said Scott Brown , a student who was at the party .
" It was honestly scary .
It was one of those moments when it was fight or flight .
And everybody just ran . "

When the shots were fired people ran through a courtyard to escape , and even into nearby apartments .

" One of the victims actually walked into the apartment and took his coat and it was just drenched in blood , " said Jaclyn Basso , a student who was at the party .
" I was having a lot of fun and then it happened and now , instantly I do n't feel safe here .
I do n't feel safe walking out of my apartment now
and I just feel really uncomfortable . "

" One of my buddies came and like start pounding on our door , and we did n't know it was him so , that freaked us out , " said Clay Freysinger , an SVSU sophomore .

Students remain concerned that the shooter is on the loose .

" That 's scary that they 're still on the loose and they could be back here next weekend or whenever , so , hoping they catch him soon , " Hegarty said .

The sheriff 's office asks anyone with information about the shooter to call 989 - 790 - 5450 .

If you 'd like to remain anonymous call CrimeStoppers at 1 - 800 - 422-JAIL.

A hotline has been established for parents , students and families to call .
The number is 989 - 964 - 4348 .
Those calling are asked to reference the shooting at 2207 Pierce Road .

SVSU spokesman J.J. Boehm released the following statement on behalf of the university :
 " While this incident happened off campus and we are thankful that no SVSU students were injured , we are actively working to support our students and parents , as well as faculty and staff .
As of 11 a.m. , we had taken more than 100 phone calls from concerned parents and others who called the hotline we put in place .
We will continue to update our campus community and the public , should new developments arise .

University Police continues to be working closely with the Saginaw County Sheriff 's Department , which is leading the investigation .

Based on the information available , we have resumed normal campus operations ; that includes hosting today 's 9 - 11 Heroes Run .
We recognize no college campus is a sanctuary , SVSU included , but thanks to a shared commitment to the well - being of others demonstrated by our students , faculty , staff , and alumni , we are proud of our fine record of campus safety over many years .
We will remain vigilant in maintaining that level of safety . "
