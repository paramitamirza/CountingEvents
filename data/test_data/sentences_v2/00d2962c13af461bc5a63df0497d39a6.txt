The June 7 gathering on Tish Lane had erupted in gunfire , sending the nearly 800 attendees running for cover .
But Morgan , 19 , lay bleeding in front of a house and unable to move .
She had been shot behind her right knee .

By the time the deputies reached her , Morgan was unconscious and bleeding profusely .
Even with the critically wounded young woman in desperate need of care , the deputies struggled to get basic information , such as the home 's street address , from the people still there .

" I 'm trying to get ( street ) numbers out here , " a deputy said , according to radio communications obtained by The Post and Courier through a S.C. Freedom of Information Act request .
" Nobody 's giving me any ( information ) . "

Morgan would later die of her leg wound , and the deputies ' frustration would continue in the coming months as the Berkeley County Sheriff 's Office has struggled to gather solid clues leading to her killer .
But Morgan 's family hopes that the release Thursday of a renewed plea for information in exchange for a heightened reward will change that .

Through fundraising efforts that collected more than $ 7,000 in donations , Morgan 's loved ones have boosted the standard $ 1,000 reward offered to people whose tips prompt detectives to solve the case .
By Thursday , that amount had reached $ 8,440 , Crime Stoppers of the Lowcountry said in a flier .

Morgan 's mother , Kendra Morgan - Stevens , has helped lead the effort to draw attention to the case and to draw key witnesses out of silence .

" I 'm hoping and praying that this will bring someone to light , " Morgan - Stevens said about the new reward .
" But I 'm not going to stop .
I 'm still going to try to raise more money . "

Through social media postings , Morgan had lamented her fear of the potential for gun violence at the party , which was hosted by a Tish Lane resident .
She went anyway .

The college student was not involved in the dispute that led to the gunfire , but she was one of six people who were wounded during the ordeal .
The others survived .

No clues from those surviving victims or the hundreds of witnesses have led to any arrests .
About a half - dozen different calibers of bullet casings were found at the scene , but the investigators were not sure exactly how many people were firing guns .
They also found live handgun rounds scattered about .

The recordings of deputies ' radio communications depicted their efforts to gather the evidence before fleeing witnesses trampled it .

" It 's chaos out here , " one lawman said .

Morgan 's slaying was the first in a string of three shooting deaths for the Sheriff 's Office that have remained unsolved .
Deputies also have not arrested any suspects in the June 30 death of 15-year - old Alonza Williams near Ladson and the Sept. 14 homicide of Joshua Leo Holmes near Goose Creek .
They have handled five killings in all of 2014 .

Touting the new reward in Morgan 's case , the Crime Stoppers flier appealed to witnesses to step forward and submit anonymous tips .
People who have heard rumors on the street about who was involved and attendees of the party were urged to speak up .

" If you have information , even if you think investigators already have it , it is important that you make that call , " the flier stated .
" You may just have the missing piece of the puzzle that will bring justice for Ariel and closure for her family . "
