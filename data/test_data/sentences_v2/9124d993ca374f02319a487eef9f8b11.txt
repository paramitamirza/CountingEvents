Detroit Police said five people were shot late Sunday night at a block party on the city 's east side .

Gunfire erupted around 9:30 p.m. outside a block party near Gratiot and Whithorn , officers at the scene said .
Details were scarce .

The conditions of the five gunshot victims were n't immediately known .
Detroit Police spokeswoman Cassandra Lewis said early this morning that she had no additional information .

The five male victims -- ages 14 , 18 , 29 , and two 19-years - old -- all received gunshot wounds and were listed in temporary serious condition at a local hospital .

Police closed off Gratiot between Houston Whittier and Jane while they investigated the scene early into the morning .

Detroit Police Capt .
Rodney Cox of the city 's 9th Precinct said there appeared to have been a large gathering at a party store , where people were celebrating the release of a new album by an unspecified performer .
Cox said 2 - 3 gunmen fired shots from across the street at the crowd , injuring five people , including the 14-year - old boy shot in the leg .

Cox said there were no indications that any of the injuries were life threatening .
But the situation appeared to be volatile ; even as he was interviewed early this morning , there were shots fired nearby east of Gratiot , and more ambulances arriving .
It was n't immediately clear if those shootings were related to the earlier ones .

Sgt .
George O'Gorman says no one is in custody and an investigation is ongoing .

The incident follows a shooting last week that left a 19-year - old gunman dead and 11 other people wounded at a block party .
