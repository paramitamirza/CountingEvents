 Neighbors expressed frustration and disbelief in the aftermath of the shooting .

" We should n't have to live like this .
It 's almost like we 're under siege or something , " neighbor Peggy Harris said .
“
There 's no value on life anymore and bullets do n't have eyes .
I mean , the people on the other end of this , they need to pull themselves together .
”

Cincinnati police said numerous people were outside when shots rang out Wednesday night .

" I was in my yard pulling weeds from my plants , and I heard I think about two or three gunshots , " Harris added .

" That baby could have been anybody 's baby , ” neighbor Leyxus Warren said .
“
He was somebody 's baby and it 's wrong .
I have a six month old , what if we were outside , what if she was in her walker .
”

Police said that witness accounts have been somewhat murky throughout the investigation .

Assistant Police Chief Paul Neudigate said safety of neighbors is their primary concern , and someone has to be held accountable .

" This is just completely unacceptable , ” Neudigate said .

We need to put this one down .
We need to hold someone accountable . "
