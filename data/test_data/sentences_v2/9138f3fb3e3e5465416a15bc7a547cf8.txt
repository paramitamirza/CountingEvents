Fire in Chicago Suburb
NEWLINE On July 21 , a fire ignited in a two - story dwelling in the Chicago suburb of Hillside .
The Village of Hillside ( Ill. ) Fire Department ’s initial response included an engine , a truck and an ambulance , and additional engines soon arrived from Berkeley and Westchester .
On arrival , there was smoke showing from the basement window wells and from the rear of the building .
Fire Chief Michael Kuryla called for a box alarm that brought in an additional engine , truck and ambulance , as well as a fire investigator , a rapid intervention team and a change of quarters ambulance and engine .

The fire eventually went to a 4 - 11 alarm , mostly because of manpower needs .
Right off the bat , a water main blew .
The incident was on the south end of the department ’s area where the water supply situation is not great .
Chief Kuryla had concerns that they would lose their water , which would be especially problematic considering the potential exposure problems .
As such , Kuryla had an engine establish a water supply that was delivered to the rear of the building from another community on the block behind the fire building .

According to Kuryla , upon his arrival , there was fire and pressurized smoke blowing out of three basement window wells on the east side .
This home had an open - type stairwell from the basement to the second floor , and fire was blowing out of the basement 6 feet from the front door .
Two lines had no effect on the fire .
They were going to cut a hole in the living room floor for ventilation , but the floor was already starting to sag .
Kuryla ordered all companies out , and the floor collapsed in about 5 minutes .
He then announced to dispatch and over fireground that this was a defensive fire .
Shortly thereafter , the entire first floor collapsed .

The fire soon spread to the second floor and the roof .
Firefighters chased the fire for about 3 hours .
They used a combination of handlines , master streams and a ladder pipe .
They even attempted a CAFS attack early into the fire right after the floor first collapsed .
Additionally , a firefighter working in the rear who was attempting to remove a door with a fire stream fell into the burning basement .
A “ mayday ” was called but , fortunately , he got onto a table and was pulled out about as fast as he fell in .

There were no injuries at the fire , which required rotating many firefighters in and out .
Ultimately , more than 25 departments responded .

The fire allegedly started as the homeowner was refinishing his basement floors with the help of friends who had a floor - refinishing business .
The floor sander was in a utility room , and a finish was being applied to the floor when they saw smoke coming from the floor sander .
They tried to put out the fire with a fire extinguisher and a garden hose .
By the time they stretched the garden hose into the basement , the fire was way ahead of them .
