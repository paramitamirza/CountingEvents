 ( WMC ) - Memphis police are investigating a shooting that sent four teens , one who was 19 years old and three who were 17 , to the hospital late Monday night .

The shooting happened Monday around 10:45 p.m. at the Foote Homes complex in the 300 block of Foote Park Lane , near Downtown Memphis .

" All you could hear was like boom , boom , boom , " said Shirley Miller , who lives in the neighborhood .
" That was the most horrific thing I 've ever lived through .
Sounded like there was an actual war going on right here in our neighborhood at our front door . "

The concrete column on Miller 's front porch was caught in the crossfire of whizzing bullets .

Investigators say the teens who were shot were in an SUV , driven by Porshia Malone .
She says she was giving her cousins and his friends a ride to a party .

" We just heard it and then when we looked over , the man was like this just shooting at my car with some long gun , and I panicked .
I put my head down .
My cousin just threw me out , " Malone said .
" I feel lucky to be alive .
I feel like it was n't my time , but everything happens for a reason .
I guess it 's a wake up call . "

Malone said she does not know what sparked the shooting .
Investigators are still working to determine the reason behind it , too .

" What is it coming to ?
What is so bad that you 're afraid to be in your own home ? "
Miller asked .
" I just hope that the young people stop .
Stop .
There 's nothing that bad where you have to shoot up the neighborhood . "

Police say the suspects were seen leaving the scene in a white SUV.
No other suspect descriptions are available .

All four victims were treated at the hospital and were released .
