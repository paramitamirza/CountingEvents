West Baltimore teen charged with shooting , trying to rob students
An 18-year - old who police said shot a student and tried to rob another in separate incidents was arrested Thursday night .

Police chased Kyree Greene about 8:30 p.m. and caught him later that night near Mondawmin Mall in West Baltimore .
Police said he tossed a Keltec 9 mm Luger .

More than a month ago , police announced they were searching for the teenager from Penn North .
And the community , police said , was helpful in identifying Greene .

He 's being held without bond at Central Booking .

The teenager has been charged with attempted murder , armed robbery , assault , reckless endangerment , theft , also illegally possessing and firing a gun , and more .

Some of the charges come from the May 23 shooting in Howard Park near Forest Park High School .
That afternoon , a 16-year - old boy told police he was walking home with friends when a masked man in a camouflage jacket opened fire .
The boy was shot in his thigh and ran home .
Police said the gunman was Greene .

About two weeks later , a 17-year - old boy was walking to pick up his cap and gown at Frederick Douglass High School , when someone stuck a gun in his back .
The boy and robber struggled .
And the robber shot himself then ran away , police said .
The boy was n't hurt .
The high school was locked down .
Police named Greene as the suspect in that robbery .

Thursday night , officers near Druid Hill Park noticed a man who appeared to be armed on Gwynns Falls Parkway .
The man took off , police said , and the officers chased .
Once caught , he said his name was " Tavon Jackson , " but detectives determined he was actually Kyree Greene , police said .

His public defender could not be reached Monday for comment .
