 ' He was shot 10 minutes before he even realized he was shot , trying to help his brother , ' said Guidry .
 '
Queric did n't deserve this .
He was just a child , ' said Guidry . '
He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . '

Relatives of Richardson told KRTK that the teen was due to celebrate his birthday next week , was an able student and worked at the local Dairy Queen .

Willie Young , 21 , and Randy Stewart , 18 , were arrested on Monday in connection with the shooting .

Young is charged with deadly conduct while Stewart is charged with aggravated assault , according to the Harris County Sheriff 's Office .

It was celebratory gunshots fired at the packed 18th birthday party attended by over 100 people that triggered the mass shooting that left two dead , two critically injured and 22 others injured in chaotic scenes where people jumped from second - floor windows to escape the shooting at the suburban Houston home .

 Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia said the gathering Saturday night was openly promoted using multiple social media sites , drew more than 100 people , most of them 17- to 19-year - olds , and became a ' birthday party gone wild . '

He said it appears partygoers were dancing in the home when someone armed with a pistol shot into the air in celebration .
In the ensuing confusion , another person who was armed began firing into the crowd , Garcia said .

Young people then streamed into the narrow street to avoid the burst of gunshots that followed shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday .
 '
Anytime you promote a birthday party on social media , you have no control over who to expect at your door , '
Garcia said to KRTK.
 ' What it does is indicate , that your saying to the social media world , ' I do n't know who you are , but you 're invited . '
That 's not a good practice . '

The initial shot was reportedly fired in celebration , which caused someone to react and fire randomly into the crowd .
 '
It is just a horrible combination of immaturity , access to a firearm and the inability to control oneself , ' Garcia said .

Partygoer Shaniqua Brown — who said she heard about the party through Instagram , a photo - sharing app and website — told The Associated Press it ' was not rowdy at all . '

She said she first heard gunshots in the house and they continued outside as people fled and sought cover .

One anonymous witness said that the shooting continued for five minutes and described the horrific scene outside the house as he fled to safety .
 '
I saw one guy .
He was lying on the floor with blood leaking out of his mouth and off his body and stuff , ' the witness said .
 '
And I saw another girl on the floor , and she looked like she was in shock , but she was also bleeding . '

Authorities have given varying accounts of the number of people injured , but they clarified Sunday that 20 were hurt , with 16 suffering gunshot wounds and four others varying injuries such as a fracture and twisted ankles in the panic to flee .

Garcia chastised the party organizers , who advertised the event on social media , saying ' you have no control on who to expect at your door . '

Authorities are searching for two gunmen , he said , one who ’s about 17 years old and the other believed to be about 22 .

Garcia said party organizers arranged to have people searched as they entered the home .
 '
Anytime you have to factor in a bouncer and being searched at the door , you have already taken a turn for the worse , ' he said .

Sheriff ’s spokesman Thomas Gilliland said earlier that deputies were confronted with ' mass chaos ' when they responded to the call in the residential neighborhood about 25 miles northwest of Houston , adding that ' kids were literally everywhere . '

He said witnesses reported partygoers jumping from the second floor in their scramble to flee .

Mariah Boulden said the gathering was her birthday party .
Boulden , who lives at the residence , said her brother and others were patting down people as they entered the home .

At least one parent was in the house , said Christina Garza , a spokeswoman with the sheriff 's office .

No drugs or alcohol are suspected in the shooting .

Garcia said Boulden 's mother was in the home during the party .

Two men refused to be searched and walked away , she said , then apparently hopped a neighbor ’s fence and entered through a back gate .

She said her family is planning a candlelight vigil at the home for the victims of the shooting .

Pools of blood were visible outside the two - story brick home Sunday , and the garage door was bent after people had pushed it upward while trying to escape .

Bruno Figueroa , who lives a few houses down the street , told The Associated Press he heard five to 10 shots .

He looked out his window and saw a crowd of at least 30 people running down his street .
 '
Kids were running everywhere , ' he said .

Figueroa said people suddenly began ducking into back yards and behind vehicles in driveways , apparently trying to hide from a car that was slowly coming down the street .
Figueroa said that from his upstairs window he could hear the people who were hiding nearby .
 '
They were crying , yelling , ‘
My brother got shot,’ ‘ Why did they do this?’ he said .

Figueroa said as soon as the slow - moving car rounded a corner and then sped away , the people who had been hiding gathered back in the street .
