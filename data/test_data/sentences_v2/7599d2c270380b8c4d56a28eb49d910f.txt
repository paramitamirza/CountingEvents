Officers from the Glendale Police Department were in the area of Port Washington Rd . and
Hampton Ave .
around 4:45 p.m.
 " The cops were right behind them .
It was like a blink of an eye , everybody was here , " said Lamont Lanfair , a witness .

Lanfair works across the street .
He thought at first , it was a regular traffic stop .

" I did n't think anything tragic happened like this .
So I went back into the building and helped a guest , " Lanfair said .

The child was taken to Children 's Hospital with what officials say are non - life threatening injuries .

The Milwaukee County Sheriff 's Office is overseeing the investigation .
Officials temporarily shut down northbound I-43 at Keefe as deputies look for the location of the actual shooting .
The interstate was reopened to traffic at 7:40 p.m.

" It 's unspeakable .
Especially for a little kid , that age , to have to go through this , and for the parents to deal with this , " Lanfair said .

The Milwaukee County Sheriff 's Office has not said what led up to the shooting -- or if there are any suspects .
