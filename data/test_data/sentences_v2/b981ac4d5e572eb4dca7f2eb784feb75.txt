Into Deadly Shootout - Erie News Now : News , Weather & Sports | WICU 12 & WSEE
Erie police have recovered a 4th gun , as part of the investigation into two East high school students shot and killed over the weekend , following a party on 29th street .

There have been no arrests in the deadly shootout in the 200 block of west 29th street late Friday night .

But Erie Police Chief Randy Bowers says detectives are taking calls , and continue to interview witnesses .
While some people are coming forward with information , Chief Bowers says more witnesses need to step up with any information they may have , " We have had a couple people respond to our request , we hope for more , " said Bowers .
" We just want to say again , that no matter how small the bit of information is you might have it 's important for you to contact our detectives and give us that information , " Bowers said .

16-year - old Elijah Jackson was killed in the gunfire Friday night .
Sunday , the coroner 's office said 16- year - old Shakur Franklin also died from injuries sustained in the shooting .

Four other teenagers , ages 13 to 17 , sustained what police say are non - life threatening injuries .

Erie police detectives recovered the new evidence from inside an SUV , that officers say crashed near at the scene .

Police already recovered a gun from under that vehicle after it crashed , and two more guns outside , in the area of the shooting .
Chief Bowers says police are analyzing the guns , as well as shell casings and live rounds discovered at the scene , to see if the recovered weapons are connected to the shooting .

Police say they know the 18-year old owner of the vehicle , and that is a part of the on - going investigation .

Erie Police say the shootout happened during what 's called an " eviction party " at the apartment house .

But whether or not the adult party host will face any charges , Chief Bowers says is a secondary part of this investigation , " Our priority right now is two dead teenagers , we know they were killed by gunfire that 's our number one priority " Bowers said .

Some neighbors told us they called 911 several minutes prior to the shooting , to report a large crowd getting out of control .

But , WICU & WSEE did some digging and found no calls were ever made to 911 prior to the shooting , and only one call came into the non - emergency line , just two minutes before the shots rang out .

If you have any information , you 're asked to call Erie police at number , 870 - 1120 .
