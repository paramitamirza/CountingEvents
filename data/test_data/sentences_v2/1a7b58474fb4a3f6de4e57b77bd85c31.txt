 ( 01/25/16 ) - A toddler has been killed after police say he accidentally shot himself .

The call went out over police scanners shortly after 11 p.m. Wednesday for a 3-year - old who had been shot north of downtown Flint in the University Park subdivision .

We learned Monday morning that Karmelo Johnson somehow got a hold of a handgun that was unsecured somewhere in the home .
While he was playing with it , he accidentally shot himself in the head .

He was pronounced dead at the scene after an EMS crew arrived .

Flint Police Chief James Tolbert told ABC12 News the homeowners may not have known the gun was in their home .

" It 's uncalled for .
It should n't of happened and some simple common sense could of prevented this , " Tolbert said .

Now the question remains - will anyone face charges in this child 's death ?

We talked with Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton about the case .
He said it 's still under investigation , and went on to say , " No matter how the facts turn out , I implore our citizens to keep weapons out of the reach of children .
To not do so can result in this kind of tragedy . "

Tolbert says his investigators are working to figure out who the gun belongs to and how it got there .
