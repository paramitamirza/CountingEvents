Host regrets not calling police sooner after shooting erupts at Halloween party
SAN
ANTONIO - One of the hosts of a Halloween party where five people were shot early Sunday morning said he regrets not calling police sooner after uninvited guests shot at his guests .

Michael Mata , 26 , said one of two shooting suspects was wearing a Freddy Krueger costume .

The party , which took place in the 2900 block of Aspen Meadow , started around midnight .

" Everybody was just having a really good time enjoying themselves , " Mata said .
" Having fun , playing games , just having a really good time . "

Mata said the mood of the party quickly changed when uninvited guests showed up .
A fight started outside in the front yard when they were asked to leave .
Shortly after , shots were fired .
Police responded just before 5 a.m. Sunday
 " I thought all of those gunshots were just warning shots shot in the air .
I did n't even turn around ( or ) look back .
I did n't want to see , " Mata said .

Police said four men and one woman were shot .
The victims include one of Mata 's closest friends , amateur boxer Luis Carrasco .

" It was a shotgun .
We do n't know what gauge of shotgun it was , and it was about three to four feet away , and he ( Carrasco ) got shot right in the abdomen , " Mata said .

The party host said he wo n't throw another party as a result of the experience .
He also regrets not calling the police when the party crashers first arrived .

" At the time there was a female leaving in an Uber , and the Uber driver saw the person running towards the party with the shotgun .
He thought it was part of his costume , " Mata said .

Mata 's biggest focus now is supporting Carrasco during his long road to recovery .
Carrasco was scheduled to make his pro - boxing debut in December .
