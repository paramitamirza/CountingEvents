Police believe four shootings in Norfolk Sunday are connected
NORFOLK , Va. ( WAVY ) —
Four people were injured from gunshot wounds in the Campostella section of Norfolk Sunday evening .

Police say they were notified of a shooting on Selden Avenue around 10:45 p.m. Officers found one man with an apparent gunshot wound in the 1600 block of Selden Avenue .

Another man was found one block away on Oakfield Avenue .
Both men were taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital .

Around that same time , two men with apparent gunshot wounds walked into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital .
Officers were later spotted speaking with people outside of the hospital .

Dispatchers believed the victims were linked to a report of shots fired in the 1600 block of Selden Avenue .
Police said Monday afternoon that they believe the shootings are connected .

Police say all four victims appear to have non life - threatening injuries .

On Monday , one of the victims spoke exclusively to 10 On Your Side ’s Brandi Cummings .

Bryan Gibbs described in great detail what happened .
It was an experience he calls unreal .

Gibbs gave 10
On Your Side exclusive access inside his Norfolk home to show where a bullet shattered his bedroom window and went through his headboard .

Gibbs explained that he , his girlfriend and 3-year - old daughter were in bed nearing sleep when they heard gun shots .

It started down here and it got past the house and it stopped , ” he said .

They thought it was over , instead the shooting started again .

The next thing you know , another set .
Boom , boom , boom , boom .
I hear glass break and I feel it .
I feel it hit my face , ” he said .

Gibbs said he scrambled to get everyone to safety , grabbing his family and pushing them off the bed .
Seconds later , he realized he had been hit .

“ I reached down , I grabbed my leg and that ’s when I pull up and I see all this blood all over my hand .
”

Gibbs said the bullet went through one leg and grazed the other .

10
On Your Side captured video of police on the scene minutes after the shootings happened .

Police say all they can say right now is that there was a cookout going on and at least one of the victims was attending , but they haven’t said what ultimately led to the quadruple shooting .

It ’s just unreal .
Its just unreal , ” Gibbs said .

Now out of the hospital , he ’s replaying the ordeal in his head , just grateful for life .

When I got to looking where the bullet when through the headboard , if my legs would not have been there , it would have hit her and my wife .
They wouldn’t have been here , ” he said .

This isn’t the first time Gibbs witnessed a shootout .
He said in June , he narrowly escaped being shot right outside of his house .

According to Norfolk Police , in that case , someone different was shot in the foot , but wouldn’t cooperate with their investigation .

Now after two shootings nearby , Gibbs said his family is considering a new place to call home .

I’m not afraid .
I’m not afraid for myself .
I’d take another bullet for my wife and daughter anytime , anytime .
I’m scared for them , ” he said .

Detectives are still investigating .
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Norfolk Crime Line at 1 - 888-LOCK - U - UP.
