Seattle - area blood bank sued by transgender woman
SEATTLE EMPTY -
 A transgender woman has filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against a Seattle - based blood bank saying she was fired after changing her donor profile to female to match her reissued birth certificate .

In the lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District court in Tacoma , Stephanie Binschus alleges Bloodworks Northwest treated her differently from other employees even though she made sure the company was fully aware of her transition .

Binschus was a long - time donor to the organization formerly known as the Puget Sound Blood Center before her transition and before becoming an employee .
Her attorney says she was accused of falsifying her donor record after the organization changed its policy on gender identification .

Attorney Jillian T. Weiss says being fired because you say you are a woman and your employer does n't agree is a violation of state and federal law .

The blood bank said it could not comment on the lawsuit .
