 Action News Crime and Safety Expert Randy Sutton , a retired police lieutenant , about how officers train extensively on how to stop a threat while being aware of what else is in their direction of gunfire .

" Police officers are trained extensively on any collateral damage and they want to minimize or eliminate it if at all possible , " he said .
