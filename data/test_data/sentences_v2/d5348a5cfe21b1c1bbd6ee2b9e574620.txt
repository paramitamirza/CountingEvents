Judge dismisses whistleblower suit against county
WAILUKU –
A 2nd Circuit judge has dismissed a nearly four - year - long whistleblower lawsuit against Maui County bought by a former liquor control officer trainee .

On June 24 , Judge Peter Cahill dismissed the lawsuit filed by Justin Dobbs against the county .

In the lawsuit filed in October 2012 , Dobbs claimed he was retaliated against because he made complaints about “ illegal and unethical activities ” in the county Department of Liquor Control and wanted to report the activities to the Maui Police Department .

Dobbs was fired in August 2011 .
He alleged that his dismissal constituted retaliation in violation of the Hawaii Whistleblowers’ Protection Act .

In a news release last week , the county announced that Cahill had dismissed the lawsuit and found that Dobbs “ had no evidence to support his claim and that the county had fired him on legitimate grounds . ”

The lawsuit also named former Department of Liquor Control Director Franklyn Silva , who has since retired , and three other department employees .
Those claims have been dismissed as well , according to court records .

The findings of fact , conclusions of law and final judgment were being prepared by county attorneys .

The county said that the firing of Dobbs was the result of an investigation that showed he had physically threatened his fellow employees , been insubordinate and attempted to use his position as liquor control officer to obtain special treatment from a licensed liquor establishment .

But in an interview Friday afternoon from California , where he now lives , Dobbs denied the findings of the county investigation and said that many claims of wrongdoing came after he was fired .
 “
I’m completely shocked , ” he said of the ruling to dismiss his case .

He pledged to continue to pursue his case against the county and the Department of Liquor Control .

Dobbs said that his attorney Venetia Carpenter - Asui , who is having health issues , was not present at the June 24 hearing .
Without a legal adviser , he was unable to understand why Cahill threw out his lawsuit .

“
They didn’t have grounds to fire me , ” Dobbs maintained .

Carpenter - Asui could not be reached for comment Friday .

According to the lawsuit , Dobbs observed violations by liquor field supervisors at about a dozen bars and other establishments serving liquor , starting when he was hired as a liquor control officer trainee Oct. 16 , 2010 , and continuing through April 16 , 2011 .

He claimed he saw what appeared to be underage girls running into a room at an establishment and being blocked by a liquor inspector from entering the room , and a sexual encounter between a field supervisor and a drunken patron .

He also alleged that owners and managers of businesses policed by the Department of Liquor Control delivered weekly gifts of food , including sushi rolls , pastries and doughnuts , to the department office .

In the lawsuit , Dobbs was seeking reinstatement to his job with seniority , back pay and benefits , as well as other unspecified damages .

Dobbs is an Army veteran and prior to his employment with Maui County was a deputy sheriff at the Yuba County Sheriff ’s Department in Marysville , Calif.
