 Twin 17-year - old brothers were killed in a drive - by shooting early Sunday in Old Town — among 17 people shot and killed in Chicago between Friday evening and Monday morning .

It was the deadliest gun - violence weekend so far this year , according to homicide totals tracked by the Chicago Sun - Times .
Besides those shot and killed , 41 other people were wounded in gun violence citywide .

Edwin and Edward Bryant were standing outside about 3:15 a.m. in the 1300 block of North Hudson when a dark - colored vehicle drove by and someone inside opened fire , according to Chicago Police .

The brothers were two of four teenagers shot dead in Chicago since early Saturday .

The spike in violence over the weekend was on the mind of Chicago Police Supt .
Eddie Johnson when he addressed the media at Navy Pier Monday morning , after a graduation ceremony for the department ’s newest officers .

It was a tough weekend , ” Johnson said .
 “
Clearly there were a lot more people outside , but you would think people would be in a better frame of mind given the fact that the Cubs are playing in the World Series , ” he added .
“ The majority of these shootings this weekend were gang - related , we know that . ”

This year ’s highest total for fatal shootings on a weekend had been 13 ; that number was reached on both Father ’s Day and Labor Day weekends .

In another particularly violent stretch , nine people were killed in city shootings and 13 others were wounded on Monday , Aug. 9 .

“ Until we start holding repeat gun offenders accountable for these crimes , they’re going to keep seeing cycles of gun violence like this .
The majority of these shootings this weekend were gang - related , we know that .
But they just have no fear of the consequences of their actions , ”
Johnson said Monday .
These violent gun offenders are clearly giving us the message that they just don’t care about the rest of the city of Chicago .
To be quite frank , I’m sick of it and I know the people in the communities are tired of it .
That ’s why we have to do a better job of holding those individuals accountable .
Johnson said that in the case of the Bryant twins , “ we do have video footage of that incident .
We’re making progress on it .
The two brothers , as far as we could tell , they didn’t have any documented gang affiliation .
But the individuals they were with did .
So it ’s possibly gang - related .
He added : “ We are making substantial progress on a number of those cases over the weekend .
We just have to ensure that we keep working hard and I know the detectives will .
Edwin Bryant was shot in the chest and back and was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital , where he was pronounced dead at 3:45 a.m. , according to the Cook County medical examiner ’s office and police .
Edward suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and head and was also taken to Northwestern , where he was pronounced dead about an hour later .

The fraternal twins were juniors at Marshall High School in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side after transferring from Lincoln Park High School as freshmen , according to Edward ’s youth basketball coach .

Edward played basketball for the Marshall and for the Chicago Demons , a youth basketball program in Old Town , according to Chicago Demons Coach Vince Carter .
Edwin also played basketball until middle school .

Carter said Edward played on the Demons’ traveling team since 6th grade .
Earlier this year , the Demons won the Bigfoot Classic in Houston and the Las Vegas Live tournament .
About 30 teams competed in the tournament in Houston and about 75 teams in Las Vegas .
He was a big part of [ those wins ] , ” Carter said .

Standing 6-foot-5 , Edward played forward and could dunk , Carter said .
He “ had a Kevin Durant look…and had been coming into his own in the last few years .
”
He probably would have played college basketball , and Division I college teams “ were looking at him .
He played hard , ” Carter said .
He loved basketball … but you had to push him to realize his potential .

 Edward can be seen dunking at the end of the video below that was Tweeted by a teammate .
