 ADAMS COUNTY , Colo. --
A quadruple shooting early Sunday morning left two men dead and two other people injured , the Adams County Sheriff 's Office said .

Neighbors said it started as a dispute between ex 's and escalated quickly .

The shooting happened just after midnight at the Berkeley Village Mobile Home Park near West 54th Avenue and Sheridan Boulevard .

“ I 'm sad , I 'm angry , I 'm torn down ,
” Lorenzo Heredia said .
To see my friend die in front of my face . "

Heredia said he spent the night outside his brother 's trailer drinking with family and friends .
It was quiet , he said , until a truck pulled up to the neighboring home .

About five guys and a girl got out and went to the neighbor 's house .
We heard a lot of banging and they pulled him out of the house and started beating him up , ” he said .

Heredia said they stepped in to help .
He said his brother , Rojelio , fired two rounds into the air to scare off the group .

When they were leaving they shot back at us and hit my friend .
My cousin was shot .
My neighbor was shot , ” he said .

“ I heard the car speed off and hit these bumps over here , ” said Carlos , who lives a block from where the first shooting happened .

He said people in a car fleeing the scene fired more shots .
 “
After that you can tell he still shot off a couple rounds .
They found the shells right there , ”
Carlos said .

It seemed to be nothing but a vengeance shooting , ” said Don Davidson , another neighbor and friend of the Heredia ’s .

Rojelio Heredia , 24 , is in custody facing a charge of first - degree murder with extreme indifference .
From the other group , Brandon Karr , 24 , is also facing the same charge .

Neighbors said whatever happened , it should have never escalated to the violent point that it did .

Everyone wants their guns and everyone wants their safety , but no one really uses their guns responsibly anymore . "

Adams County detectives said they are confident all suspects are in custody and there is no danger to the community .
