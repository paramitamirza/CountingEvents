2-year - old Marion boy injured in gun accident
No charges will be filed against the parents of a 2-year - old Marion boy , who accidentally shot himself with a 22 caliber gun .

According to Marion County Sheriff Rob Craft , the parents of the boy alerted authorities about the incident around 8 p.m. Friday , Nov. 21 .

?We were advised they were transporting their 2-year - old son to St. Luke Hospital in Marion , ?
Craft said .

?When officers arrived ( at the hospital ) , they found that the two - year - old had a single 22 caliber gunshot wound to the upper inside arm and rib area .
?

The investigation , he said , revealed that the child gained access to the handgun being stored in a gun - safe .

While the door was open , and a parent was accessing some of the safe?s contents , he said , the child grabbed the barrel of the pistol hanging on a hook inside the safe door .

?While pulling on the barrel of the pistol , it discharged and the bullet struck the child in the upper inner arm , then the rib area , ?
Craft said .

After striking the rib , the bullet fragmented with only a small portion of the fragment entering the child?s chest causing minor internal injury .

Craft said the young boy was transferred to Wichita for further examination and was released .

?The investigation of this incident has been concluded with this listed as an unintentional discharge , ?
he said .

?There is no such thing as being too safe ( when it comes to guns ) , ?
he said .

A gun safe is critical , but even so , children can get into places where adults don?t expect them to go , Craft added .
