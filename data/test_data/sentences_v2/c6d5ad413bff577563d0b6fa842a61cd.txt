11-year - Old Shot On Winchester
An 11-year - old girl remains in critical condition after what appears to be an accidental shooting .

It happened around noon at the Somerset Park Apartments on Lake Park Drive off Winchester in southeast Memphis .

Memphis police are still investigating , but an MPD spokesperson says a child was playing with a gun when it accidentally fired , hitting the victim .

" It 's kinda crazy though , if it comes to a child playing with a gun .
Where was the parent ?
Where was the gun at ? "
asked resident Cynthia Terry .

All questions Memphis police are working to get answered .

Terry is shaken up over the news an 11-year - old girl was shot just two doors down from her apartment .

Terry says her son had been outside playing with a few kids , including the victim , earlier in the morning .

" Was out earlier this morning playing with these same children that got shot this morning .
It could 've been my son .
It 's horrible , " said Terry .

Terry is not only shaken up over the shooting , she 's mad and says there 's no excuse for what happened .

" If youâ€™re supposed to have a gun in your house , it 's not supposed to be nowhere where a child can find it , period , " said Terry .
" My son , he come out here every day and want to play .
And I feel like if I 'm going to keep him huddled in the house .
Then it 's not a place for us to be . "

She wants to know how kids had access to a gun and who was supposed to be watching them .
