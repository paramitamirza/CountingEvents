" We do n't know whether it was just a fight that spilled out of the school .

They run and get weapons , " Police Commissioner William Evans said in an afternoon news conference .

 " When a 17-year - old dies on the street , coming out of school , then we all should be outraged , and shame on anybody who does n't step up to the plate and help us solve this , " Evans said .

Police and city officials called on the community to help them identify whoever was responsible .

" One homicide is too many homicides .
A mother and parents are going to be notified today that their son has been killed .
And I think that we have to do more and we need the entire community to do more , " said Mayor Marty Walsh .

At a school committee meeting Wednesday night Superintendent Tommy Chang said trauma counselors would be at the school Thursday for students and staff .

" We send our condolences to the family and pray that one day we can see an end to senseless violence in this city and this country , " Chang said .
