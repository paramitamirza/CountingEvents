 Toledo police apprehended a suspect in a west Toledo neighborhood after a carjacking and shooting situation on Friday afternoon .

It all started when Toledo Police got a tip that Michael Miller Jr. was driving up to Toledo from where he was staying in Tennessee .

Toledo Police Chief George Kral says Mr. Miller had a sinister motive .

" He had a gun , a shotgun and he was going to kill his wife and kids , " said Chief Kral .

Police however , were able to get the family to safety .

According to police , the wild events started at 4:21 p.m. when police say Miller shot up a house in the 14-hundred block of Milburn Ave .

Soon after , Miller shot at a home in the 7-hundred block of Fernwood .

Later , Miller is said to have carjacked a white Dodge Avenger at Erie St. and Logan and drove to Dorr and Lawrence where he shot at a pedestrian .
The pedestrian was uninjured .

At a BP gas station at Dorr and Reynolds , Miller attempted to carjack another car , but ended up driving away in the Avenger .

While at the BP , Miller confronted a civilian .

A witness described the encounter .
 "
Through the tussle they fell on the ground .
They were fighting each other going back and forth , three or four shots rang out throughout the store in the process , ” said Johnny Reese .

Luckily , police say no one was shot from the three rounds that were fired .
The civilian suffered non - life threatening injuries .

After abandoning the Avenger in a neighborhood , Miller fled on foot .

It was in a neighborhood off of Hill Avenue in South Toledo where police finally chased down Miller on foot .

Police were able to apprehend him without exchanging any gun fire .

Toledo Police say Miller had active warrants in Michigan and Ohio .

Chief Kral had nothing but good things to say for Toledo Police , the Lucas County Sheriff ’s Office and the Ohio State Highway Patrol for working together and successfully bringing the suspect behind bars .

" I want to give a special shout out to the dispatcher ’s office .
They were juggling four active crimes scenes at the same time trying to coordinate information to let us know what was going on to keep us safe . "

Miller is being held at the Lucas County Jail on a $ 1 million bond .
