The firefighters were shot while responding to a medical call .
The shooter is in custody and is cooperating with police , Stawinski said .

The incident began at about 7:30 p.m. , when firefighters and police received a 911 call from a man who was worried about his brother at a home in the 5000 block of Sharon Road in Temple Hills in Prince George 's County , police said .

When they arrived on the scene , the firefighters tried to communicate with the man in the home , but there was no response .
When they tried to go into the house , the man inside fired several rounds , striking the two firefighters and his brother who called 911 , officials said .

The man has been released from police custody , the department said about 7 p.m. Saturday .
No charges have been filed .

" There was only gunfire from the resident of the home directed at public safety .
After public safety got into the residence , the situation immediately became calm and no police officers fired any weapons .
It was simply the resident inside , " Stawinski said .
" After several rounds were fired and I think they realized it was public safety , that 's when the confrontation ended . "

Ulmshneider was in " extremely critical condition " and was flown to Southern Maryland Hospital Center , where he was pronounced dead .

" Right now , we 're here supporting the family as best as we can and to prepare to send our brother home , " Deputy Fire Chief Benjamin Barksdale said .
