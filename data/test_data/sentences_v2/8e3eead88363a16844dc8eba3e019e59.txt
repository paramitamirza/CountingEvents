Mother of 3-year - old fatally shot speaks out ; Detroit man charge - Fox 2 News Headlines
The suspect police believe shot and killed 3-year - old Amiracle Williams has been charged with her murder .
Police formally charged 23-year - old Donnie Everett .
He was arraigned on nine counts Monday including first degree murder and four counts of assault with intent to murder .
Home from the hospital after being shot in the leg , 40-year - old Freida Tiggs said coming home to a life without her daughter Amiracle is unbearable."This pain I can get over , but I just really miss my baby , " Tiggs said .
" I do n't know how I 'm going to live without my baby."Amiracle was shot and killed at their east side Detroit home on Mogul and Hayes last Thursday after a Facebook feud and a fight outside."I wish I could 've taken the bullets , " Tiggs said .
" I wish I could have made it to her in time."Tiggs , who was shot and beaten , says when she looked at Amiracle shot twice in the chest , she knew she lost her baby."I was hoping that it was n't true , " she said .
" I just had that feeling."Also caught in the gunfire was Amiracle 's father , 47-yo Demetrius Williams and her sister 's friend 17-year - old T'Kira Steen , who is seven - months pregnant."T'Kira called me and said she got shot . " said Nancy Steen , T'Kira 's mother said .
" I was just crying , going crazy."Four others who survived the shooting are recovering."These kids are so out of control it 's just ridiculous , " Tiggs said .
" And to try to be a showoff , for what?"Police expect more charges to come against others involved .
Amiracle 's mother says she has no sympathy for anyone who can point a gun at a baby and pull the trigger."You did n't care about coming to my house to hurt my child , " Tiggs said .
" Now you have to deal with it."Tiggs wanted to thank the public for their support , but Amiracle 's family still needs some help .
