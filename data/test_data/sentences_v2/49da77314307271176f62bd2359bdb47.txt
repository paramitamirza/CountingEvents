The Routt County law enforcement community was in mourning Thursday after learning about the apparent accidental shooting of the 3-year - old son of a Steamboat Springs Police Department officer .

“ It ’s a tragedy in our family , and we’re focusing on the welfare of our employee and his family , ”
Police Chief Cory Christensen said .

The boy was at his home in the Stagecoach area with his parents when he was shot .
A person called 911 at 8:38 a.m. to report a boy had shot himself .

The names of the parents and the boy were not being released Thursday .

“ We want to make sure that all the family members have been contacted , ” Routt County Coroner Rob Ryg said .

The Routt County Sheriff ’s Office was investigating the shooting and had called the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to help .

Undersheriff Ray Birch would not say if the boy was alone when he was shot or what kind of gun he was shot with .
He would also not say whether the boy was shot with a gun issued by the police department .

“ I can not give you details of our investigator ’s interview with the parents , at this point , ” Birch said .

After the boy was shot , he was driven toward Steamboat by his father and a friend .
They were met on the way by Steamboat Springs Fire Rescue paramedics , who then took the boy to Yampa Valley Medical Center .

It was a number of hours before we received the sad news that he passed , ”
Birch said .

Birch said they were in the process of reconstructing what happened inside the home .

Birch said it was hard to find the words to describe how the law enforcement community was feeling .

It ’s very emotional , ” Birch said .
We’re like a family .
We’re very close .
