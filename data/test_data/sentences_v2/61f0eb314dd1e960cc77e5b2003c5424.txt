3 teen girls , 1 man shot in retaliatory drive - by shooting , police say
DAYTONA BEACH —
Four people — three of them teenagers — were shot late Tuesday night in what investigators are calling a retaliation shooting linked to a 2015 murder .

Police Chief Mike Chitwood said three men opened fire from a car on Tuesday night about 11:30 as they drove by a house on the 1000 block of Sheridan Road .
Ronald Williams , 22 , was standing outside the residence speaking with three female friends , one of them only 14 , the chief said .

The three suspects then sped off in a white Hyundai and police began pursuing them as they headed south on U.S. 1 , Chitwood said .

" We believe this is in retaliation to the Deandre Smith killing on the bridge , " the chief said , referring to the fatal shooting of the 24-year - old Smith on May 10 on the Oakridge Boulevard bridge .

The trio of shooters ended up in South Daytona and bolted from the Hyundai at the 1700 block of Palmetto Avenue , the chief said .
Police located one of the men , Ricardo Watson , 28 , inside an apartment at the 1700 block , Chitwood said .
Watson 's brother Rakim Watson , 27 , and a third suspect however , are still on the run , Chitwood said .

The chief said investigators believe that Rakim Watson is one of the people who shot and killed Smith as he drove east on the Oakridge Boulevard bridge the night of May 10 .
Smith had just left the now - defunct Papi 's bottle club on Nova Road where he had been involved in a fight in the parking lot , police said .
He was followed onto the bridge by another car where shots were fired from .

Smith was struck and lost control of his car , crashing it at the bottom of the bridge .
The car came to a stop at a doctor 's office on Oakridge Boulevard .

The chief said since that killing , there have been several shooting skirmishes involving two factions — the one retaliating for Smith 's death and the one backing Smith 's killers .
In one of the shooting incidents last year , two men fired at each other on Pearl Street near Bethune - Cookman University and one of the men was shot in the buttocks .

Chitwood said Williams was Smith 's best friend .
The chief also said the house where Williams lives is also the same residence where Smith 's grandmother , 3-year - old daughter and his former girlfriend live .
In July 2015 , someone drove by the house and shot into Kaiyana Riddick 's Saturn .
Riddick was Smith 's girlfriend and the mother of Smith 's child , police said .

Two handguns meanwhile were recovered from Tuesday 's shooting , the chief said .
And on Wednesday morning , South Daytona Police found an AK-47 rifle in the backyard of a house on Linda Circle , said Lt .
Dan Dietrich .
The house belongs to an elderly snowbird couple who spotted the weapon when they were doing yard work , Dietrich said .
Chitwood said that along with handguns , a high - powered rifle was also used in the Sheridan Road shooting Tuesday .

The chief said none of the four people shot face life - threatening injuries .
Williams was taken to Halifax Health Medical Center and the three teenage girls — besides the 14-year - old , one is 18 , the other is 19 — drove to the P.A.L. Center on George W. Engram Boulevard and called police for help .

Ricardo Watson has been charged with burglary because he entered the apartment of a stranger on Palmetto Avenue , Chitwood said .
It 's not yet clear if he was one of the shooters .

" This is all about street justice , " Chitwood said .
" No one wants to tell law enforcement what they know , they just want to take care of it themselves .
And now four people have been shot . "

Anyone with information regarding Rakim Watson and the third suspect is asked to call Daytona Beach police , 386 - 671 - 5100 .
