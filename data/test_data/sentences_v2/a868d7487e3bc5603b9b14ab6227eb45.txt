 A Detroit police officer vividly recalls rushing to an area hospital with his arms covered in the blood of a child shot during a domestic dispute Tuesday on the city ’s east side .

Officer Chris Rabior detailed the harrowing incident in a Facebook post late Wednesday that has more than 650 reactions and more than 400 shares .
On his page , Rabior lists his occupation as “
Police Officer at Detroit Police Department .
”
 “ Just prior to what should have been the end of my shift , I found myself lifting the nearly lifeless body of a seven year old boy from the back of our scout car and onto a stretcher for staff waiting on his arrival , ” Rabior said .
My partner expertly drove at ludicrous speeds to get him there while I gave his mother instructions on how to control the bleeding between giving updates to dispatch on our ETA and location .
”

Under Rabior ’s status , he posted a link to a story about the little boy , who was shot around 10:45 p.m. Tuesday on the 3600 block of Fairview .

A man , identified by police as Torrey Craft , had argued with the boy ’s mother a day earlier , before returning to try and visit a child they have together .
But the woman ’s brother blocked him and “
the suspect attempted to shoot him and struck the child , ”
Officer Nicole Kirkwood said .

Craft turned himself in around 2 p.m. Wednesday at the department ’s 5th precinct .

My hands should have been busy tapping away at a keyboard , writing a report about the four guns we got off the street earlier in the shift , ” Rabior said of the hectic moments after the shooting .
Instead my hands were covered past my elbows in the blood of a child .
”

It remained unclear if the victim is the child the suspect was attempting to visit , police said .
He was outside with several other people when he was shot .

The gunman fled the scene following the shooting in a Chevrolet TrailBlazer .
Prior to his surrender , police said an extensive search was underway .

The investigation is ongoing and police expect to submit a warrant packet to the Wayne County Prosecutor ’s Office for review , according to Officer Jennifer Moreno .

I know a lot of people wonder why the hell I would ever want to work as a police officer in Detroit , ” Rabior said at the beginning of his post .
“ It ’s an absolutely crazy place to work .
I’ve been shot at .
I’ve been assaulted .
Pretty good odds my nose has been broken once or twice .
 “
I’ve seen terrible things .
I know the smell of gunfire , the smell of death , the smell of decomp .
I’ve had to listen to firsthand accounts , and see the results first hand , of how horrible people can be to one another .

“ I’ve been the focus of hatred directed towards me solely based on the uniform I chose to wear .
I’ve been threatened by gang members .
I’ve been promised shootings by people we’ve caught on felonies that ‘ next time , we’re gonna bang it out.’ ”

But Rabior used Tuesday ’s night ’s rescue as proof his job is worth all that risk .
 “
( The boy ) made it through surgery .
He ’s listed critical due to his age and the amount of blood he lost .
But he ’s alive , ” Rabior said .
“ I don’t know his name , but I’ll never forget his face .
He ’s why we do what we do .
