LAKE STEVENS , Wash. --
It 's been four months since Michael Holzworth , a 3-year - old Lake Stevens boy , was shot in the face with his dad 's loaded gun .
His dad faces a reckless endangerment charge , which is a gross misdemeanor .
But Michael 's mom and grandparents want the law changed to make it a more serious offense .

In November 2014 , Michael 's family says the 3-year - old accidentally shot himself in the face while his dad was in a different room .
His mom had left the house that night to attend a funeral for a friend .
Michael survived the shooting , and his family says he 's recovering and is doing well .

Michael 's maternal grandparents said the day prior to the shooting , they brought gun locks over for Michael 's father because they say he often left guns out in the presence of their grandchild .

" He told me he would never put those on his personal firearm because he needs those for protection .
And I said , ' What about Michael ? '
He said , ' Michael wo n't touch it . '
Michael did n't deserve to be shot and it was the irresponsibility and the stupidity of one person , " Faith Thayer , Michael 's grandmother , said .

Thayer said her family firmly believes in the right to carry , but they think irresponsible gun owners need to be severely punished .
She said they plan to work with local legislators and advocacy groups to create stricter laws .
They 're pushing for legislation that would take guns away from adults who are irresponsible with firearms around children .

" If you have children in your home , you should have your gun on your person , and if you 're going to put that gun down , it should be put in a safe , " Thayer said .

Jon Holzworth , Michael 's father , did not return calls for comment on this story .
Holzworth 's arraignment is set for April 2 .
