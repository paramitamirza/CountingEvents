 NEW ORLEANS ( AP ) - A second suspect in the Bourbon Street shooting that left one person dead and nine others injured was arrested Friday .

Acting on information gathered in the investigation , Louisiana State Police found and arrested Kavon Manuel , 20 , at a home in the Lafayette area .

Manuel will be extradited to New Orleans to face a charge of second - degree murder and nine counts of attempted murder , New Orleans police said in a news release .

The arrest comes after New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison , New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and state and federal law enforcement announced the Thursday night arrest of Jordan Clay , 20 , as the other suspect in the incident .

Harrison said Clay and Manuel had an ongoing dispute and just happened to run into each other early Sunday on Bourbon Street .

Killed in the cross fire was Demontris Toliver , 25 , of Baton Rouge , Louisiana .
The surviving victims included seven men and two women , ranging in age from 20 to 37 .
Police said none of the wounded had life - threatening injuries .

" We made a promise to track down the suspects responsible and bring them to justice , and together , we made good on that promise , " Harrison said .
" I want to thank the Louisiana State Police , FBI , ATF and Lafayette Police Department for providing the resources we needed to get the job done . "

It was n't immediately known if either Clay or Manuel had a lawyer .

The French Quarter shooting erupted hours after Saturday 's annual Bayou Classic football between Southern University and Grambling State University - and the tourist district was bustling with visitors after the Thanksgiving holiday .

Harrison said the shooting , which occurred about 1:30 a.m. Sunday , had nothing to do with the classic matchup .
He also said that between 30 and 40 police officers and EMS crews were in the district then and responded quickly .

Landrieu praised that fast response Friday .
Speaking at a news conference , he also said the shooters showed " a complete disregard for the lives of those around them . "

Toliver 's father Kim appeared at the news conference and held up pictures of his son .
He asked " each and every one of y'all to keep us in your prayers , " saying that he has lost " a part of my life . "

Demontris Toliver was a tattoo artist and a New Orleans native .
