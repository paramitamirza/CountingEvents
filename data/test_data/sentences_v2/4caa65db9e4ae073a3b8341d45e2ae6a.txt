" We 're early in our investigation .
We 're going with the leads that are coming in and we are still working on it , " Crawford said .

On Monday , neighbors said that what occurred the night before had been building for hours .

" It was multiple fights , a lot of arguing with teenagers around here .
It started around 2nd Street and escalated to 3rd Street .
Cops got called out a couple of times , " said Carmen Pacheco .

" There were two or three fights , the same kids kept going back and forth , fighting back and forth and I could see it was escalating , " said Luis Diaz .

The neighbors said police would respond , the kids would leave and so would police .
But , once the officers were gone , the problems would resume .

" The fourth time came the shooting , " said Pacheco .

What actually sparked the shooting is still under investigation .
Several elected officials , including the mayor , were on scene Sunday night .

Residents could be seen giving those officials an earful , pointing to a nearby surveillance camera .
On Monday , some residents said they want more police on routine patrol , even officers walking a beat .

" I got five kids and I 'm scared to bring them out here .
Really scared , " Diaz said .

New Castle Council President Chris Bullock was among those on the scene Sunday night and heard the request for more boots on the ground .
