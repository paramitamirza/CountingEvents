5-year - old killed in reported accidental shooting in South Lubbock
A 5-year - old boy is dead after what was reported as an accidental shooting Tuesday evening in South Lubbock .

Cynthia Flores left her home around 5:10 p.m. to take her kids to dance class .

She drove out of her cul - de - sac and noticed two children at the end of the block playing in the yard .

More than an hour later , Flores was blocked down the street from her home by police cars and crime scene tape .

One of the two kids she’d seen less than two hours before was dead .

Lubbock police responded to a call about a shooting in the 2500 block of 71st Street at 6:03 p.m.
 Jason Lewis , LPD patrol sergeant , said a 5-year - old boy had been shot and taken to Covenant Women ’s & Children ’s Hospital .
 “
Doctors worked on the child , ” he said , but he did not survive .

Four people , including the parents and two kids , were home at the time of the incident , he said .

Police said the boy was shot with a rifle .
Other details , including who shot the child and how the incident happened , were still under investigation Tuesday night , but Lewis said it was believed to be accidental .

Flores said she ’s seen the family of four outside often while going on walks with her own kids .
She and her family moved in about four years ago and the family was already there .

Flores described her neighbors as “ sweet ” and said she often waves and says “ hi ” when she ’s passing through .

Melanie Hernandez and Lauren Jackson , both Texas Tech students who live on the street behind the family , said they were on their way to the gym when they noticed all the police cars and saw the EMS trucks pull up .

A swing set could be seen Tuesday night behind the fenced - in backyard , and a small , red push car could be seen just inside the garage .

Hernandez and Jackson said they always see the kids outside .

“ They would pretend to hammer on the fence , ” Hernandez said .

Sylvia Botello was sitting inside Trinity Church just across the street from the scene when she saw the first responders pull up .
 “
In the 27 years I’ve worked here , I’ve never seen anything like this , ” she said .

Hernandez said she considers it a safe neighborhood and was “ shocked ” at the news of the child ’s death .

Lewis said the incident is under investigation and did not release names .
