Candlelight vigil held in wake of fatal slaying of three men
Candlelight vigil held in wake of fatal slaying of three men
 The " Fourth Ward of July " celebration was intended to bring food , fellowship and music to a shrinking corner of the historic Freedmen 's Town near downtown Houston .

But as hundreds gathered Monday for an evening of personal pyrotechnics , hip - hop entertainment and the anticipation of big - city fireworks , a different sort of pop rang out .

The crowd was attacked by gunfire in the dark , leaving three men dead , two people wounded –
including a 10-year - old boy – and a community originally settled by formerly enslaved men and women shaken by the violence
.

On Tuesday night , about 100 people gathered around the scene of the shooting for a candlelight vigil .
Speakers especially singled out one of the dead , Charles Jackson , a father of three , nicknamed " Screwball .
" A styrofoam cup sign pushed into a fence read " We ' heart ' U Screwball .
"
 Families sat in lawn chairs and listened as Pastor Elmo Johnson led them in prayer .
" Please have mercy on our Fourth Ward , " Johnson , pastor at the Rose of Sharon Baptist Church , prayed .
" We love this Fourth Ward you put us in . "

Deric Muhammad , an activist whose family is originally from Fourth Ward , told the crowd : " Last night the block was shut down in hate , tonight we want to shut it down in love . "

Before Monday 's shooting , witnesses estimated more than 1,000 people had gathered for the block party on Wilson between Andrews and Saulnier .
Grammy - nominated Houston rapper Paul Wall , the biggest name on the bill , had hyped the audience for their clear view of " Freedom Over Texas , " which was happening footsteps away across Allen Parkway .

" Three or four males showed up with guns and started shooting , " said Sgt .
Derrick Fontenot , a Houston Police Department homicide investigator .
On Tuesday , he called the incident " " intentional " but was reluctant to identify a motive or provide descriptions of the assailants .

Witnesses and community members said they believe one of the dead men was a target for a revenge killing to settle the score on a murder in another neighborhood .

By Tuesday evening , only one of the dead men had been identified officially by authorities .
Jamal Dataunte Dixon - Lackey , 26 , of Houston was one of the three men fatally shot around 10:30 p.m. Monday .

Relatives and friends identified another man , Charles Jackson , as the second decedent .
Known as " Screwball , " he was described by loved ones as a devoted father of three small children who was a steady volunteer at the neighborhood 's Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church .

A third deceased man 's name has not been disclosed by authorities or loved ones .

All five of the wounded were rushed to local hospitals late Monday , where three of the men died .
The child and the other man , 37 , were expected to survive , though details of their injuries and conditions were not released .

Party tents pitched on a grassy lot were still standing Tuesday morning .
Folding tables held barbecue sauce , white bread , aluminum pans and other trappings of a cookout .
Rolling coolers remained parked in the grass .

On the other side of the police tape , investigators made their final rounds amid shell casings and discarded food containers .

Deonicia Curry returned to the neighborhood Tuesday morning to retrieve her car , which was sequestered by the police investigation overnight , and talk to people about the loss of her friend Screwball .

The 33-year - old attended the party with her 3-year - old daughter , mother , grandmother as well as about two dozen relatives and close friends .
She said when the gunshots began , people dropped their belongings and started running .

" You were just trying to get your baby and go home , " she said .
" Everyone comes out , watches the fireworks , we barbecue and we have fun .
But this time , my friend was just trying to enjoy the Fourth of July with his kid and someone walked up on him and shot him and another innocent bystander .
It makes no sense .
It 's sad .
A lady has to tell her kids their Daddy is gone .
A mama loses her son . "

Tears began streaming down Curry 's face as she thought back to the episode that took Jackson 's life .

" I guess God needed him more than we did , " she said between sobs .
" This is so sad . "

She vowed that 2016 was her last time attending the event .

Jackson 's great - aunt , Rosaland Jackson , said the party happened beside her family 's corner store , which was the focal point of the block party .

" A lot of strange sounds went off and that 's when everyone started running .
We knew it was some gunshots , " the 56-year - old said Tuesday morning as she walked around the area seemingly in a daze .
" Everybody was scrambling trying to run to safety .
Hundreds and hundreds of people .
Adults and kids .
"

Shortly , someone came in the store and said Screwball had been shot .

" We 're just living in cruel times where a man has no love for mankind , " she said .
" We will heal by grace and mercy .
Charles knew God .
He was a blessing around this neighborhood .
We just need to stop a lot of the nonsense . "

For John Burns , he not only lost a distant cousin , but a best friend and an annual homecoming he 's been organizing for the last few years .

Like Curry , he 's finished with the event as well as his other block parties , sports tournaments and stop - the - violence gatherings " for the hood , " he said .

" It 's me and him all day every day , " he said of Screwball .
" We do everything together .
He 's all about his kids .
He 'd do whatever it takes for them .
He 's all about his family . "

Burns , a DJ and rapper , was coordinating artists between minding his laptop and speakers on a stage outside of the store when the gunfire erupted .
He ushered his girlfriend and one of his children into the building , then someone beckoned him to check on his friend .

He cradled Jackson in his arms , he said , then went with the injured man 's father to rush him to St. Joseph Hospital downtown .
Screwball did n't make it .

Burns , 34 , believes the assailants used the opportunity of a thick crowd and the diversion of firecrackers popping off to kill .

The episode of cold reality imitated art in the worst way .
Earlier this year , Burns performed on a tribute rap video called " Another Day " that celebrated the lives of more than a dozen young men whose lives were snatched by violence .
The short film shows Charles Jackson sitting with Burns in a Fourth Ward cemetery –
backed by the Houston skyline – reminiscing about people gone too soon .

A sung chorus line repeats throughout the song : " Wish I could get another day .
"
The final image is REST IN PEACE on a black background .

A $ 5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the lone shooter or the gunmen .

Anyone with information on identities of the suspects in this case is urged to contact the HPD Homicide Division at 713 - 308 - 3600 or Crime Stoppers at 713 - 222-TIPS ( 8477 ) .
