An Immokalee teenager who was injured in a shooting earlier this week accidentally shot himself , police said Thursday .

Collier County Sheriff 's Office deputies responded to a call about a shooting that had left a 15-year - old boy injured Tuesday afternoon near the intersection of South Seventh Street and Colorado Avenue , according to a police report .

When police arrived at the scene , David Bettancourt was being treated for a puncture wound to his right thigh by Collier EMS medics , police said .

Bettancourt told deputies that about 45 minutes earlier he had been walking north on South Seventh Street when " an unknown number of subjects in a small black passenger car traveling east on Colorado Avenue fired at least one shot from an unknown type of firearm at him , striking him in the leg , " according to the police report .

Bettancourt then ran to his cousin 's house in the 300 block of South Seventh Street , the report stated .
Bettancourt 's cousin called 911 from a neighbor 's house , according to the report .

The teenager was flown to Lee Memorial Hospital for treatment .

Deputies searched the scene of the shooting for evidence but could not find anything , the report stated .
Police also could not find any witnesses , and there was no video surveillance footage .

Bettancourt could not tell police why he had waited 45 minutes to report the shooting , according to the police report .

When deputies interviewed Frankie Rodriguez , another cousin of Bettancourt 's , on Wednesday , Rodriguez told police that he , Bettancourt and " another adult male " were at the residence at the 300 block of South Seventh Street on Tuesday , according to a different police report .

Rodriguez told police that the " other adult male " had brought two illegal firearms to the residence and that Bettancourt had been playing with one of the guns when it accidentally went off and injured the teenager , the report stated .

Rodriguez and the unidentified man fled the scene before police arrived because " they did not want to get into trouble , " according to the report .

Deputies arrested Rodriguez on Wednesday and charged him with violation of state probation .

Because the investigation is ongoing , police could not identify the other suspect , Collier County Sheriff 's Office spokeswoman Kristi Lester said in an email .

No charges have been filed against Bettancourt , she said .
