Police got a call about a possible shooting around 5 p.m. and found the male victim on the porch suffering from an apparent gunshot wound , Baton Rouge Police spokesman Don Coppola Jr. said in a news release .

Around 25 people stood behind caution tape at dusk , watching police process the scene at 1915 Birch Street .
The teenager , wearing a black sweatshirt and patterned pants , lay motionless on the top step leading into the blue front porch of the home .

Six police units ringed the house while a woman beyond the tape was overheard making a call to her workplace saying she wouldn’t be coming in because someone had killed her brother .

There are no motives at this time , Coppola said .
