Teen who died playing Russian roulette identified
PUEBLO , Colo. -
 Pueblo police say a dangerous game cost a teenager his life Monday night .

The 17-year - old was identified Wednesday as Cruisito Leiba .
The Pueblo County Coroner 's office says he died from a single gunshot wound to the head .

Police were called to a home in the 2100 block of E. 14th Street Monday night just before midnight .
Witnesses told police the teen had been playing Russian roulette when he shot himself .

When officers arrived Leiba was still breathing but he later died at the hospital .

" This game is absolutely dangerous .
It will kill you .
And we do not want any kids playing this game , or adults , " said Capt .
Kenny Rider .

Police said several other teens were at the home when the incident happened but the victim was the only one playing Russian roulette .

" Everybody verified or confirmed that this juvenile who died had been playing that game , had spun the cylinder and pulled the trigger at least four times before it actually fired , " Rider said .

Russian roulette is played by putting a single bullet in the cylinder of a gun , spinning the cylinder then putting the gun to one 's head and pulling the trigger .

Rider said fatalities involving Russian roulette are not common in Pueblo but said , " We do n't want this to become a trend , either . "

Police have n't recovered the gun used in the shooting .
