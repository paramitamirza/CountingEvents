In a horrific case of neighborhood gun violence , a 15-year - old Detroit girl was shot and killed early Sunday after a family member tried to get a speeding car to slow down on their street .

But instead of slowing down , police said , the driver pulled out a gun and opened fire , killing a teen girl who was attending a family gathering on the 14300 block of Ardmore on the city 's west side .

Someone at the scene hopped in a car and tried to chase the shooter , but lost control of the wheel and struck a pole while the gunman got away , police said .

" Everything happened so fast , " said Detroit police spokesperson Nicole Kirkwood , who urged the public to call police with any tips .

The incident happened at around 2 a.m. Sunday during a family event or party of some sort .
Police said a car sped past the house when someone at the party either instructed them or told them to slow down .
But the driver opened fire instead .
