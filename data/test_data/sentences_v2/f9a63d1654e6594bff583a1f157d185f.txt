Senseless Hollywood Blaze Kills Cat and Injures Dog
On Tuesday , August 8 , 2006 at 10:34 a.m. , 13 companies of Los Angeles firefighters , four LAFD rescue ambulances , one arson unit , two urban search and rescue units , one hazardous materials squad , three EMS battalion captains , five battalion chief officer command teams and one division chief officer command team , under the direction of Assistant Chief Michael Fulmis responded to a Greater Alarm Structure Fire at 5741 Carlton Way in Hollywood .

Firefighters arrived quickly to find heavy fire showing from one unit on the top floor of a 36,710 square - foot three - story apartment building .

Using handlines , firefighters mounted a brisk offense against well - entrenched flames within the one unit , confining the fire to a bedroom and extinguishing blaze in just fourteen minutes .

As the fire was completely extinguished and property salvage efforts continued , firefighters identified two residents and a dog who had escaped the blaze .
Suffering mild to moderate effects from smoke and heat exposure , the 67 year - old man and his 23 year - old daughter adamantly declined treatment and hospital transport .

While the father and daughter arranged care for their pet dog which had sustained a minor burn injury , it became the painful task of firefighters to advise them that their pet cat had succumbed to the flames .

There were no other injuries reported .

The presence or functional status of smoke alarms within the involved unit at the time of the fire could not be immediately determined .
The apartment was not equipped with fire sprinklers .

Because their apartment was temporarily untenable , the man and woman were referred to the American Red Cross for placement assistance .

Monetary loss from the fire is estimated at $ 40,000 ( $ 30,000 structure & $ 10,000 contents ) .

The cause of this late - morning blaze is categorized as accidental and attributed to carelessness with a candle .

This fire comes less than three weeks following the U.S. Fire Administration 's formal release of an official report highlighting the fact that nationwide on an annual basis , candles are responsible for an estimated 23,600 residential structure fires , cause 1,525 civilian injuries , 165 fatalities and $ 390 million in direct property loss .
