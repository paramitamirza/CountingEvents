Lilburn man , 20 , killed in Gwinnett shootout
It didn’t look good to one Gwinnett County resident when 20 young men gathered in the street after 10 p.m. Two groups were ready to fight , a caller reported to 911 .

By the time officers arrived Wednesday night , dozens of shots had been fired , multiple houses and cars had been hit , and a 20-year - old man was dead in the street .
Three others were also injured by gunfire and in stable condition late Thursday .

As officers worked throughout Thursday to piece together what happened , residents of Reddington Lane picked up the pieces , including glass from broken windows .
Multiple homes and vehicles were damaged by bullets , so many that Gwinnett police could only guess .

“
It would be fair to say dozens at this point , ”

Jake Smith said .

No arrests had been made late Thursday and police declined to speculate on what may have led to the shootout , other than it was a disagreement .
It wasn’t known why the groups met on a neighborhood street , just off Singleton Road .

“ We have two conflicting parties that had two conflicting viewpoints on some matter that led to a physical confrontation and then the physical confrontation led to a shootout , ” Smith said .
“ When we have two opposing groups like this and we have a fairly large number of people involved , that will be an angle that we’re going to investigate , whether or not there was any gang activity going on here .
”
 Tre Edwards of Lilburn was killed in the shootings .
The names of three others who were injured were not released , but they were all in stable condition and expected to survive their injuries , police said Thursday .

One of the shooting victims was found by a police K9 on an adjacent street , where he was seeking shelter in a shed , according to police .
All of the people shot were adult or teenage males , Smith said
 Investigators believe all of those shot were involved in the altercation .
At least one bullet entered a room of a home and another went through the headrest of a parked car , but no other injuries were reported .

Marlene Ebanks , who has lived in the neighborhood for six years , said she was in her bedroom when , “ all of a sudden , I heard all of these gunshots , and then I heard a car screeching , speeding off .
”

Ebanks said there has been “ a lot of trouble ” recently in her neighborhood .
 “
You see a lot of drug trafficking going on in the neighborhood , ” Ebanks , who is from the Cayman Islands , told The Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
“
It makes me feel like I want to pack my clothes and leave and go back home to the islands .
You don’t feel safe . ”
