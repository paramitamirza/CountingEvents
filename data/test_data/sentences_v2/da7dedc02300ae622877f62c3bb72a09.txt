 Farmington Hills —
Faith Harris - Green was too overcome Friday to speak about her four murdered children , but their personalities shone through in a letter she wrote for their packed funeral service .

Nineteen - year - old Chadney Allen Jr. was a “ strong , unique and smart ” young man who loved giving his mother tight hugs .

The 2015 graduate from Southfield High School recently completed a certificate in digital media arts from Specs Howard .
He was good at art , with his work once exhibited in the General Motors building in downtown Detroit .

Kara Allen , “ Kara Bear , ” was “ creative , beautiful , confident and a go - getter .
”
An accomplished student , the 17-year - old Southfield High senior was on the school newspaper , cheer team and the National Honor Society .
She wanted to be a doctor .

Five - year - old Koi , “ Princess Koi , ” loved “ wearing her dresses and getting her hair done .
She loved to be the center of attention .
Four - year - old Kaleigh , known as “ Sweet Pea , ” “ was glued to my hip .
”
The youngster , who went to St. Sebastian Catholic School in Dearborn Heights with sister Koi , loved the water and loved to sing .

Friends , family members and ministers spoke lovingly of the four slain Dearborn Heights siblings during the two - hour funeral service at Detroit First Church of the Nazarene in Farmington Hills .
An estimated 1,500 - 1,700 mourners attended .

Harris - Green , 39 , who needed the help of a wheelchair , wore a black veil over her face .

The children were slain in their home Sept. 21 , allegedly by Harris - Green ’s husband , Gregory Green .
The younger ones were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning and the older children , Green ’s stepchildren , were shot to death .

Harris - Green was slashed in the face and shot in the foot and allegedly forced to watch as her older children were killed , officials said .
Green faces a preliminary hearing Wednesday on multiple charges .

Pastor Ben Walls read the letter about Harris - Green ’s love for her children .

“ I know your love , ” the letter said , in part , and continued : “ My dear babies , I love you all .
You were always unique in your own way .
I always encouraged each of you to be your own person ... to be a leader and not a follower and stand up for what ’s right .
”
 Walls told the grieving mother : “ Faith , you were successful as a wonderful mother . ”

Chadney Allen Sr . , father of Kara and Chadney , said his loss “ is going to be hard the rest of my days .
” Allen said his children “
weren’t burdens to society .
They were going to be powerful individuals .
Mourners filed past the four caskets and cried openly .
Some who were overcome by emotion left the church sanctuary .
Videos were played , showing the smiling children with one another and their mother and the older children ’s dad .
Pink and white teddy bears hung from the caskets .
Harris - Green , like many others in attendance , wore pink .

Apostle Ron Shepherd said in his eulogy : “
Satan and his dark angels did this .
”
 Shepherd told the mourners “ to ( put ) down their anger ( and ) forgive , ” saying “ he was processed and programmed ” to do it , a reference to Gregory Green .
 “
Satan blinds the minds of men , ” Shepherd said .
“
Satan planned ( the murders ) and it wasn’t all at once .
Shepherd told Harris - Green and Allen , who sat in opposite pews at the front row of the church facing their children ’s caskets : “
Faith ...
Chad ...
God spoke ...
He said the children are with me .
Some friends of the children spoke at the solemn service .

The children were buried at St. Hedwig Cemetery in Dearborn Heights .

Green , 49 , has been charged with four counts of first - degree murder and one count each of assault with intent to do great bodily harm , torture , unlawful imprisonment , felonious assault as a felon in possession and felony firearm .
The father ’s court - appointed attorney said he will plan a motion for an insanity defense .

Green had been released from prison five years earlier after serving 16 years for second - degree murder in the death of his first wife , Tonya , who was six months pregnant .
It ’s unclear if Harris - Green knew her husband had killed his first wife and served time for the crime .
