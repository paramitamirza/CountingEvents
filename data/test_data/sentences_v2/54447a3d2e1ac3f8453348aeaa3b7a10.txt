His uncle , Richard Ruffin , told Local 10 News that Marlon was outside his home playing with a ball when he was shot .
Ruffin said he heard four to five gunshots and ran outside to help .

" I just tried to talk to him , but he was unresponsive , " said Ruffin .
" His condition just deteriorated . "

Marlon was taken by Miami Fire Rescue to Jackson Memorial Hospital 's Ryder Trauma Center in critical condition , where he was pronounced dead , according to Miami police .

Police said the incident may have been the result of a drive - by shooting , but that has not been confirmed .

Family members and friends gathered at Jackson Memorial Hospital .
Local 10 News was told many of them approached the fire rescue unit as it pulled up to the emergency entrance .

" They broke my heart , " Marlon 's grandmother , Dorothy Ruffin told Local 10 News on Wednesday .
" He was only 10 years old .
If anybody knows something please come forward . "

Marlon was not the only child to be shot Tuesday within Miami city limits .
Earlier in the evening , two 16-year - olds were shot in the 2000 block of Northwest 18th Terrace .
One of them later died .

Police said around the same time that Marlon was shot , and within the same vicinity , another teen was grazed by a bullet .
It 's unclear if any or all of the shootings could be related .

City of Miami Police Chief Rodolfo Llanes released a statement Wednesday saying in part , " Both as a parent and as Chief of Police , I was deeply saddened by the murders of Marlon Eason ( 10 ) and Richard Hallman ( 16 ) .
All life is precious , but the loss of children is even more difficult to understand .
I have directed the men and women of my department to do all that is necessary to get to the bottom of these tragic incidents , but please understand that we can not do this alone .
We need the help of the community that we have sworn to serve . "

Anyone with information about either shooting is asked to call Miami - Dade Crime Stoppers at 305 - 471-TIPS. A $ 3,000 reward is being offered in each case for information that leads to an arrest .
