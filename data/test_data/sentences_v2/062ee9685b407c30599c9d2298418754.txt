SNOWVILLE , Box Elder County â€”
A 4-year - old boy was taken to Primary Children 's Hospital after his 3-year - old brother accidentally shot him in the foot Tuesday , police said .

The two boys were at their grandfather 's home about 18 miles west of Snowville at the time of the shooting early Tuesday afternoon , said Box Elder County Sheriff 's Chief Deputy Dale Ward .

The toddler was initially taken to Bear River Valley Hospital in Tremonton with a gunshot wound that was not life - threatening , Ward said .
He was later transferred to Primary Children 's for surgery on his right foot .

The home was being cleaned in preparation for the boys ' family to move - in , Ward said , and the brothers ' 6-year - old sister and grandfather were also inside the house .
Their mother was outside while they " were inside with the grandfather playing , " according to Ward .

" The two boys found two firearms , a .22-caliber rifle and a .410-gauge shotgun in the home , " Ward said in a prepared statement .
" The shotgun , a single shot exposed hammer model , was being handled by the 3-year - old boy .
It is believed that the boy was able to cock the hammer of the shotgun and fired it in the general direction of his 4-year - old brother . "

No charges were filed against the boys ' mother or grandfather , whose names were not released , but an investigation is ongoing , the chief deputy said .
Both guns were taken by police as evidence .
