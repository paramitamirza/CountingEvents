A Uniontown teenager was charged by city police with aggravated assault and placed in the Fayette County Jail on Wednesday for allegedly shooting a friend in the city 's Pershing Court housing complex .

Amar Daeshawn Chisler , 17 , told police the shooting was accidental , according to a criminal complaint .

He was arraigned before District Judge Michael M. Metros on additional charges of reckless endangerment , simple assault and possession of a firearm by a minor , according to court records .

In an affidavit of probable cause , Uniontown Detective Donald Gmitter stated that police were called to a Pershing Court residence at 12:31 a.m. Wednesday for a report of a male with a gunshot to the head .

Police identified that person as Dametrious Addison , 18 , of Pittsburgh , who was flown to Ruby Memorial Medical Center in Morgantown , W.Va .
, for medical treatment .

His condition could not be obtained on Thursday .

Gmitter said he observed a blood - soaked mattress and carpet in an upstairs bedroom , and a .38 Special revolver on a nightstand .

Gmitter said that in an interview , Chisler said that he and several friends , including Addison , were “ hanging out ” together and that “ Meech ” had a gun , which he placed on the bed .

“
Amar stated that he does n't like guns , so he used a paper towel or napkin to pick up the gun and move it .
When Amar picked up the gun , he stated that it ‘
went off . '
Amar threw the gun onto a nightstand and began to render aid ( to Addison ) , ”
Gmitter wrote in the affidavit .

Chisler was transported to the city police station for questioning , where he admitted shooting his friend and stating that it was an accident , according to the affidavit .

According to Gmitter , a Fayette EMS first responder who tended to Addison asked him who shot him .
 “
He said , ‘
It was my friend , ' ” Gmitter wrote in the affidavit .

Metros set Chisler 's bail at $ 35,000 .

He faces a preliminary hearing Dec. 22 before Metros .

In 2012 , a man whom Uniontown police identified as Chisler 's brother , Ramal O. Chisler , pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and carrying a firearm without a license in a similar incident .

Chisler , now 21 , was 16 when he was charged as an adult in the Sept. 16 , 2010 , shooting death of Tiffany Moody , 17 , also in a Pershing Court apartment .

According to Chisler 's statements during a plea hearing , he was dismantling a handgun when it discharged unexpectedly , accidentally firing a bullet into Moody 's upper left abdomen .

Ramal Chisler told police that he was dismantling the handgun because Moody did not like firearms , but her family disputed that claim .

A sister , Jennifer Moody - Garrison , said their father , a hunter , taught them how to handle firearms properly as they were growing up .

Fayette County Judge Nancy Vernon sentenced Ramal Chisler to a term of six to 12 years in prison .

He remains in custody in the State Correctional Institution at Somerset .
