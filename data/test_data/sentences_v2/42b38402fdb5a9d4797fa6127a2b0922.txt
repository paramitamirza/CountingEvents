Sheriff : Young brothers cooking before shooting kills 2
 By JONATHAN MILTONAssociated Press
 HUDSON , Fla. ( AP ) - A 12-year - old boy was cooking with his older brother when an argument erupted , and the boy shot his 6-year - old brother to death , wounded his older brother in the leg and killed himself , a sheriff said Thursday .

Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco previously said the argument Wednesday night was over food , but at a news conference a day later he would n't talk about it , saying only that the older boys were preparing food and deputies were still investigating .

The boys were identified as 12-year - old Kevin Pimentel , 6-year - old Brady Pimentel and 16-year - old Trevor Pimentel .
They were home alone at the Sugar Lane Mobile Home Park north of Tampa while their mother was at work , Nocco said .

The sheriff refused to release many details about the crime , including the motive and where the boy got the gun , because he said deputies have n't told the mother yet .

" The mother is going through a living hell right now , " Nocco said .
" She does n't yet know all the details .
She ca n't handle that right now .
She emotionally and physically ca n't handle that right now . "

Trevor Pimentel called 911 at 6:19 p.m. Wednesday .
When a deputy arrived , Trevor was screaming " I 've been shot , I 've been shot " from inside the mobile home , the sheriff said .

Authorities said they have found no evidence that child welfare officials or police had ever been called to the home before the shooting .

The mother , Helen Campochiaro , was a hard - working woman who had two jobs so that she could take care of her boys , the sheriff said .
Campochiaro had been in a car wreck recently , but did n't even go to the hospital because she had to work , Nocco said .

On her LinkedIn page , Campochiaro says she bakes cakes for special occasions from her home .
She describes herself as a " Punky Jersey Girl " and a " proud single mom of 4 amazing boys . "

The boys ' 18-year - old brother also lived at the home , but he was not there at the time of the shooting .

Earlier , the sheriff said Kevin was 13 years old , but at the news conference he said his birthday was later this month .

Kevin was in middle school .
Brady attended elementary school and Trevor took virtual high school classes at home in the mornings and culinary classes at a technical school in the afternoons .

Grief counselors were at the schools to talk to their friends , students and teachers .

Brady 's first - grade class was told that something " very sad " had happened to him , school spokeswoman Linda Cobbe said in an email .
Several middle school students who knew Kevin went home with their parents , and a couple of teachers at the elementary school where the older boys had attended went home to be with their families , Cobbe said .

Trevor is in the hospital , and he is expected to be OK. When deputies tried to talk to him , his heart rate spiked .

" You 've got a 16-year - old who just saw something horrific , a living nightmare .
I would never want anyone to be in his shoes .
He 's grieving right now .
He just lost two brothers , " Nocco said .

The family lived in the mobile home park off a dirt road in Hudson , which is about 30 miles north of Tampa on Florida 's Gulf coast .

" We rarely see cops in the neighborhood .
It 's quiet here , " said neighbor Kipp Coleman .

The shootings happened about 2 miles from the location of another family slaying .
In August , three members of a family and a fourth man were discovered dead .
The ex - boyfriend of one of the victims is awaiting trial in those deaths .
