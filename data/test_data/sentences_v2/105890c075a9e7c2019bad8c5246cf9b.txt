Dialysis Clinic , Inc. Sued
By EEOC
For Disability Discrimination
SACRAMENTO , Calif. -- Nationwide healthcare provider Dialysis Clinic , Inc. ( DCI ) violated federal law by firing and refusing to re - hire a long - time nurse who needed more medical leave to complete her cancer treatment , the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) charged in a lawsuit it filed today .

According to the EEOC 's lawsuit , Francisca Lee had worked as a nurse at DCI 's Sacramento Southgate location for 14 years when she was diagnosed with breast cancer .
Lee took medical leave in order to have mastectomy surgery and chemotherapy treatments .
Four months later , DCI notified Lee by mail that she was being terminated for exceeding the time limit dictated by its medical leave policy , the EEOC said .
This was done despite Lee being on approved medical leave and cleared by her doctor to return to work without restrictions in less than two months .
Lee was told that she would have to reapply for open positions .
However , when Lee did apply over two months later , she was rejected , and not long after , DCI hired a newly licensed nurse .

Terminating a qualified employee because of a disability violates the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) .
The law also requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee or job applicant with a disability , unless doing so would impose an undue hardship for the employer .
After attempting to resolve the case through pre - litigation conciliation efforts , the EEOC filed the lawsuit ( EEOC v. Dialysis Clinic , Inc. ) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California .

" Given the ADA 's mandate , I would urge employers to be flexible concerning leave extensions if it causes no undue hardship , " said EEOC San Francisco Regional Attorney William R. Tamayo . "
Ms. Lee had over 30 years ' experience in dialysis treatment and really wanted to work .
Our investigation showed that she only needed two more months to return to work .
Why sacrifice a valuable employee with a good record over an arbitrary time limit ? "

EEOC San Francisco District Director Michael Baldonado added , " The purpose of the ADA is to ensure that people who are qualified and able to do the job can work without prejudice against disability to hold them back .
After her doctor cleared her for work , Ms. Lee was passed over in favor of a far less qualified candidate .
DCI 's failure to re - hire Ms. Lee because of her disability , or record of disability , violated federal law and was just plain wrong .
A healing facility such as DCI should especially understand that . "

According to its website ( www.dciinc.org ) , DCI is a Nashville , Tenn.-based nonprofit corporation serving patients with advanced kidney disease .
It has over 5,000 employees , and operates over 210 dialysis clinics in 27 states , including three locations in the Sacramento area .
