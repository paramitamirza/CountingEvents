2 children among victims in triple shooting
Two young children and an adult were shot Saturday night in east Baltimore .

City police said officers were called around 8:10 p.m. to the 900 block of McAleer Court , where a 4-year - old girl was shot in the foot , and 8-year - old boy was shot in the leg and a 61-year - old woman was shot in the leg .

Police said he opened fire on the three victims , who were outside with a number of other people .

According to police , the gunman walked up and opened fire , shooting in a " callous " manner .

While the investigation is in its early stages , police said there were many people outside at Latrobe Homes on Saturday night , and they hope people will step up to help .

" We have again , two kids , you have an old woman , do the right thing .
This could have been your grandmother .
These could have been your children , " Baltimore police Detective Donny Moses said .

All three of the victims were taken to a hospital , where they are expected to be OK.
 What happened is still fresh on the minds of many , like Rochelle Smith , who got a call the Sunday morning from a family member in the area telling her what happened .

" I was like , ' Oh my goodness .
What are they doing ? ' "
resident Rochelle Smith said .

" Whatever beef he had , he knew who he was shooting at .
He just could n't shoot , and we 're fortunate that these people did n't suffer a more catastrophic injury , " Moses said .

The shooting happened here at Latrobe Homes in the set of residences just behind me , and then the police believe the suspect took off running west .

Detectives are now doing what they can to find the shooter .
Police said the gunman is probably in his early teens and is from the Latrobe Homes area .

" They were knocking on doors , combing through grass as you guys saw , and from what I saw and from what I understand they 've reviewed some video footage that was taken in the area , " Moses said .

For some , it 's a violent reminder of how quickly things can change .

" It 's horrible and it 's scary , but we just keep on living , " Smith said .
"
Regardless of what happens , we just got to keep caring about each other and keep checking on each other . "
