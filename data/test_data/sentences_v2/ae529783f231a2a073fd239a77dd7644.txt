LA Woman Rescued From Stalled Elevator in Smoke - Charged High Rise
On Monday , May 15 , 2006 at 7:07 p.m. , 24 companies of Los Angeles firefighters , three LAFD rescue ambulances , one heavy rescue , one arson unit , one urban search and rescue unit , one hazardous materials squad , one LAFD helicopter , two EMS battalion captains , six battalion chief officer command teams and one division chief officer command team , under the direction of Assistant Chief Roderick Garcia responded to a Major Emergency Structure Fire at 21700 Oxnard Street in the Warner Center area of Woodland Hills .

The first company arriving in response to an automatic fire alarm activation , discovered forty persons calmly self - evacuating a 20-story sealed high rise office building .

As the half - dozen first responding firefighters quickly secured the lobby and adjacent fire control room , they noted smoke alarm activation on five upper levels of the building , verbal indication of fire on the 17th floor , and at least one building occupant reported missing and believed to be stranded in an elevator .

This information , relayed to firefighters/dispatchers at LAFD 's operations control dispatch section , brought the well - coordinated response of an additional 149 Los Angeles Fire Department personnel on the ground and in the air .

In accordance with LAFD 's high rise incident command system , firefighters established firm control of key building systems , including a recall of elevators to the lobby level of the 17-year - old building , as firefighters , carrying as much as 100 pounds of equipment each , commenced a steady climb up more than 40 flights of stairs to do battle with fire in the upper reaches of the third - tallest building in Warner Center .

With detailed knowledge of the structure gained during fire prevention and annual fire department high - rise drills proudly hosted by building management , firefighters made strong headway to the 17th floor , where they found fire in an electrical room and smoke charging the 17th through 20th floors as well as machine rooms above .

As an LAFD helicopter cross - staffed with an airborne engine company circled overhead , fire attack and support teams established staging on the floor below the fire , optimizing a strategic assault that confined the fire to the electrical room and fully abolished flames in little more than an hour .

There were no injuries related to the fire .

Subsequent to firefighting operations , firefighters systematically searched the buildings many elevators and associated systems to discover a woman trapped in a ' blind ' segment of a split - bank elevator that served only floors 12 and above from the lobby .
Finding the one elevator car stuck at the ' fourth floor ' level of the sealed shaft , firefighters established verbal contact with the woman , who was uninjured and not exposed to smoke .

After redundantly securing the elevator , firefighters used power tools to breach the elevator shaft wall from a fifth floor storage room , and then used a 12-foot fire department ladder within the shaft to access the woman .

Following a cursory evaluation of her condition and affirming her capabilities , she was gently assisted in climbing the ladder , and exited safely to decline further treatment or transportation .

Battalion Chief James Gaffney , ' B ' Platoon Commander of LAFD 's Battalion 17 , was quick to compliment building staff for their prompt and efficient actions prior to and following the fire department 's arrival .
The 29-year LAFD veteran offered special praise for the building engineer and electrician , who offered technical expertise and insight that helped mitigate the emergency and strengthen firefighter 's efforts at severely minimizing collateral damage from smoke and water .

Damage to the building was limited to $ 330,000 ( $ 30,000 structural & $ 300,000 contents damage - mostly from smoke ) .
The cause of the fire was determined to be electrical in nature .
The specific reason for the elevator becoming inoperative was not determined by firefighters , but may have been related to the fire .
