Police chief defends himself in wake of murder spike
Anthony Batts , nine months into his job as Baltimore ’s police chief , insisted today that he was prepared for the outbreak of violence that left 28 people shot and 10 people killed in the city since Friday .

In a joint appearance with Mayor Stephanie Rawlings - Blake , who returned to City Hall this morning after a six - day absence to attend a meeting of mayors in Las Vegas , Batts defended his leadership role .

“ I am connected to this organization .
I am driving directions almost every single hour , ” he told reporters at his first formal briefing since the crime wave began .

When the shooting spree started on Friday night , he said his chief field commander was giving him constant updates , “ and I was giving him directions every single hour this weekend , so I was aware ” of the violence .

All weekend , ” he continued , “ we knew what was taking place .
We were trying to get in front of it very quickly .
”
 Where he faulted the department – and himself – was on public relations .

Our messaging this weekend was terrible .
We should have been in front of you , telling exactly what was going on . ”

Today he revealed that he had reassigned the department ’s chief spokesman , Anthony Guglielmi , to a community partnership office following Guglielmi comment on Monday that “ all in all , we’re pretty satisfied with the way the city is headed , violence - wise . ”

Illegal Guns a Topic in Las Vegas
 Mayor Rawlings - Blake seized upon the issue of illegal guns when discussing the crime spree , noting that this matter was vigorously addressed at a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting she attended over the weekend in Las Vegas .

“ I want to again emphasize the importance of stopping the flow of illegal guns into America ’s cities , ” she said today in prepared remarks .
“ We only have one gun store in the city of Baltimore , so it ’s clear that not enough is being done to disrupt the pipeline of illegal guns into Baltimore and other cities .
In the past few days I met with my fellow mayors from across the county and this issue was front and center to all of us .
Addressing the murders that took place during her absence , the mayor said , “ I have to share with you really how angry I am and concerned about what happened over the weekend – two dozen shootings , several of them fatal .
And I say angry but
it ’s such a mix of emotions .
It ’s angry , it ’s frustrated , it ’s extreme sadness , particularly when we look at the fact that it is not outside invaders killing members of our community , it ’s us killing us .
She continued in her prepared remarks , “
It was a terrible display of ugly and senseless violence .
We know that those who perpetrate those acts [ have ] power to disgrace our communities and city .
We got to do everything to apprehend them and bring them to justice .
 “
Reducing violence , ” she added , “ is the No . 1 priority of my administration .
I will not be satisfied until Baltimore becomes one of the safest big cities in the country . ”
 “
You Don’t Understand My Outrage ”

Stepping to the dais after the mayor , Chief Batts said that news reports often refer to the number of murder victims .
These are not numbers .
These are human beings .
Referring to Donyae Jones , an African - American woman who was killed early Saturday morning on the 700 block of North Kenwood Avenue , Batts said , “
I look at this little 18-year - old girl who was lost this weekend on Kenwood .
I look as I go out on the streets at the McCulloh Homes yesterday , where some kids were out , but some gang members fired shots out there , putting at risk those young kids .
And I talked to mothers who were out there .
Outrage ?
You don’t understand my outrage about those circumstances .
I’ve made it very clear to my staff , I made it very clear to our organization , that we will respond , certainly .
”
 Batts said the Kenwood Avenue shootings , which left four people shot in addition to Jones , were related to gang rivalries .
He said three gangs , the Bloods , Black Guerrilla Family and DJ Boys , “ a new crew , ” were fighting for territory .

Deputy Police Commissioner John Skinner said that “ a tremendous amount of information ” has been coming from the community in the wake of the shootings .
A “ wave of arrests , ” he said , is about to be made of suspects .
 “
Yes , We Were Ready ”

Asked if he felt he was prepared for the surge in violence that typically strikes Baltimore in the summer , Batts said :
 “
From day one from when I walked in , we were preparing for this summer .
And getting ready .
Deputy Commissioner Skinner , one of the things I have him doing with his staff is every three months I want a plan on what we’re doing , our attack plan , our methods and our strategy .
Not only tactically but strategically at the same time .
We were prepared for the summer .
We put things in place .
We had a strategy that was out there .
He continued , “
This was a very dramatic weekend .
We were responding behind the scenes .
We were ready for it .
Yes , we had things in place .
But he cautioned that even the best planning can not prevent all crime .
The random stuff that takes place because you step on my toes or because you look at me wrong –
that was some of the things that were taking place this weekend also . ”
