 LODI --
 An 8-year - old Lodi girl was transported to an area hospital after she was accidentally shot near a relative 's apartment complex Sunday afternoon .

A man inside a nearby apartment says he was cleaning his gun when it went off , according to the assistant manager at the complex .
The bullet went through a wall before eventually striking the girl .

The girl is expected to be OK , according to her mother , who did not want to be identified Sunday night .
The bullet lost momentum after going through the wall , and did n't pierce the girl 's leg .

The courtyard of the Lodi apartment complex , on the 400 block of North Church street , is normally a haven for young kids who live and play there .

Sunday it was surrounded by Lodi police officers investigating the accidental shooting .

" I just wish out neighborhood would get cleaned up because there 's too many kids , apartment complexes , kids running around here .
You never know if a stray bullet will hit them , " said Linda Lopez , who has lived on the same block as the apartment complex for almost 20 years .
She says she saw police arrest one man after the shooting .

" Yeah .
A lot of times , " Lopez said when asked if she has seen incidents like this near her home in the past .

People inside the apartment where the girl was refused to talk to FOX40 .
Neighbors say the girl 's family went with her to Lodi Memorial Hospital .

" I came out
and I just saw cops everywhere , " said James Epler , who lives right above the apartment where the gun went off .
He says he did n't hear it but saw the aftermath .

" Accidents can happen anywhere if you 're not practicing responsible firearm safety , " said Epler .

For others the incident left a more unsettling feeling .

" I have grandkids , and a granddaughter and a grandson that 's 14 years old , and I just get scared because we do n't know what 's happening , " said Lopez .
