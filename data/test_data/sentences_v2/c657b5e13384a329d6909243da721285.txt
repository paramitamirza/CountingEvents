SALT LAKE CITY —
A man who police say shot and killed his 8-year - old son before fatally shooting himself had a history of domestic violence , substance abuse and possible mental health issues , according to court records .

On Wednesday , Salt Lake police identified those involved in Tuesday 's tragic incident as 8-year - old Xavier Lucero - Waters , and his father , Moses Waters , 46 .

Police were called by Xavier 's mother , who is Waters ' wife , to their apartment at 561 N. Center , just after noon .
When officers arrived , they discovered that the young boy had been shot with an " improvised firearm .
" The boy 's father was dead .

Xavier was taken to a local hospital , where he died a short time later .

Police did not provide more details Wednesday about the weapon used to kill the boy .

Waters , his wife and their son all lived in the Capitol Hill apartment .

" I 'm devastated , " social worker Ashley Hoopes , an advocate for children and the homeless , wrote on her Facebook page . "
Xavier Lucero - Waters was one of my favorite kids in The Road Home shelter preschool .
And on the weekends , I loved having him in my playgroup .
I was always so impressed with his sweet mother , who lived and breathed for her son .

" He was big for his age , but he had the most tender heart .
He was my son 's age so I 'd sneak him in Lego guys .
He delighted in doing dress up with the donated Star Wars costumes and making fantastic Play - Doh creations , " she wrote .
" He so wanted to master the board games with the bigger kids .
Xavier taught me so much , like you ca n't judge a book by its cover . "

In her post , Hoopes also criticized the lack of funding for mental health treatment in Utah .

" Our system is broken beyond repair , and the latest casualties are a father who suffered from mental illness and his sweet 8-year - old son and now a mother who has lost them both , " she wrote .
" This is on us — Utah and on our legislators who refused Medicaid expansion .
These are the families who are paying the price for that political game . "

According to court records , Waters was convicted in 2014 of burglary as part of a plea bargain .
In exchange for his guilty plea , charges of aggravated assault and domestic violence in the presence of a child were dismissed .

Waters , who was estranged from his wife and son at the time , came to their house and told them he was going to kill himself before walking away , charging documents state .
His wife followed him and with a friend attempted to help him .

They invited him into a friend 's apartment to talk .
But when he became agitated , they asked him to leave and then locked the door behind him , the charges state .
Waters re - entered the apartment by throwing a rock through the window .

A Salt Lake police officer happened to be nearby and heard the breaking glass and subsequent screams .
He arrived to find Waters holding his wife around the neck with a razor to his throat , the charges state .

Waters refused to let go of his wife and told the officer to shoot him , according to a Salt Lake County Jail report .
Police attempted to use pepper spray , but it had no effect .

 Waters continued to hide behind his wife to avoid being hit with a Taser by police , according to the charges .
Officers were eventually able to successfully deploy a Taser and arrest him .

Waters was sentenced to six months in jail and ordered to undergo substance abuse treatment .

In July 2014 , Waters sent a letter to the judge presiding over his case .
The letter included an update about his treatment .

" I am addressing my existing mental health issues for the first time in my life with medications , counseling and programs , " he wrote .

In December 2014 , the judge lifted the no - contact order placed on Waters , allowing him to see his wife and son again .
A 2015 court document listed his address as being the Salt Lake homeless shelter .

In 2014 , Waters served 10 days in jail for intoxication .
A charge of criminal mischief was dropped as part of a plea deal .

Waters had been married and divorced at least twice before , according to court records .
He was charged in 2006 with two counts of aggravated assault , domestic violence in the presence of a child , child abuse and retaliation against a witness .
Those charges were later dropped when one of the state 's main witnesses twice did not show up for a preliminary hearing .
