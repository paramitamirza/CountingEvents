 Detroit police say they are perplexed and angry over the spate of shootings in Detroit that have injured or killed children .

The shooting of a 4-year - old in the 18300 block of Monica on Saturday is the latest in a string of violence against children on the city ’s streets in less than a month .
Two other children were shot and killed on Easter and on April 16 in what police are calling suspected gang - related shootings and which are believed to be connected .

Detroit Police Chief James Craig is expected to address at a news conference Monday the recent violence that has snagged yet another child in another bloody weekend .

The latest shooting on the west side appears to have happened as a father was teaching his 4-year - old boy to ride his bike about 5 p.m. Saturday , police said .
The 24-year - old father was killed in the incident on Monica .

Detroit police are asking for the public ’s help tracking the whereabouts of two masked gunmen and have said they are baffled why anyone would target a child .

It ’s extremely hard on the community and on the responding officers , ” said Deputy Chief Steve Dolunt .
It ’s hard to make any sense of it .
There used to be a code among criminals : You don’t mess with kids or senior citizens , but that seems to be gone .

... Why would you shoot a kid ?
I don’t get it .
I don’t understand the mindset , but we’re constantly trying to figure this out , but the problem is , how do you get into the mind of someone with a total lack of regard for life ?
It makes you speechless .
I can’t understand it .
”

In the Saturday incident , police said two men wearing ski masks emerged from a gray Chevy Equinox and started shooting .
The 4-year - old was listed in temporary serious condition , said Officer Nicole Kirkwood .

The masked men were last seen heading south on Monica , which is west of Livernois and south of Seven Mile .
Police ask anyone with information to call the homicide section at ( 313 ) 596 - 2260 .

Saturday ’s incident follows the fatal shooting of 3-year - old A’Naiya Denise Montgomery about 2 a.m. Easter morning on the 16800 block of Riverview on the west side .

One of three suspects held in the shooting , Paul Kendall Jr. , 24 , took his life Wednesday , the Wayne County Sheriff ’s Office said .

On April 16 , 6-month - old Miracle Murray was killed as a 24-year - old man played on the front lawn of the home on Winthrop with two other children .

On Saturday , Miracle ’s mother pleaded for her killer to come forward .

I just hope somebody speaks up , ” said Jennifer Murray , holding back tears .

“ Turn him in , my baby didn’t deserve this . ”

Dolunt , reflecting on what appeared to be the indiscriminate shootings of children , said more conflict resolution skills are needed .

You just don’t shoot someone when you have a problem with them , ” he said .

( But ) if you don’t respect yourself , how can you respect someone else ? ”
