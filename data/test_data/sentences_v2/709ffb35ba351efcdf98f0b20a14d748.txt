Pre - Trial Hearing for Defendants Charged with Shooting Deaths Of - Erie News Now : News , Weather & Sports | WICU 12 & WSEE
The five defendants accused of killing two Erie teenagers in July 2015 returned to court today for a pre - trial hearing .

They are all charged with homicide for the shootings at a west side Erie party .

Four of the defendants are charged with killing 16 year old Shakur Franklin .

One of them , Darion Eady is accused of killing 16 year old Elijah Jackson .

The lawyer for Eady wants his client tried separately , a motion the prosecution opposes .

Defense Attorney Bruce Sandmeyer said , "
Mr. Eady 's case is completely different from the other co - defendants .
There are different witnesses , different alleged victims , all the evidence is going to be different . "

District Attorney Jack Daneri said , " We do n't think it is going to be difficult for a jury to separate out Mr. Eady 's actions as we have alleged them versus the other four in the vehicle .
So for that reason we did not believe a severance was appropriate . "

Other defense motions now being considered by Judge Rusty Cunningham , include a request to drop all charges , arguing sufficient evidence was not presented during the preliminary hearing .

And some of the lawyers are asking for the criminal and juvenile records of potential witnesses who may testify against their clients .

Now as far as moving the trial to another county , or having an outside jury travel to Erie to hear the case , Judge Cunningham said jury selection will start in Erie with potential jurors questioned individually .

He said if that does not work out , he will consider using an outside jury .

It is not clear when Judge Cunningham will rule on the pre - trial motions .

A trial date has not yet been scheduled .
