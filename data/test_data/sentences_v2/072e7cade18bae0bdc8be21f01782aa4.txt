" There were other non life threatening injuries reported but again there 's a lot of people involved so the detectives still investigating , " said APD Officer Destiny Winston on Sunday .

" Today in the morning I come to work and see all the policemen out there , " said Enrique Sevilla , a manager at Taquerias Las Chivas Jalisco next to the food truck .

Sevilla , 21 , works seven days a week and said safety is not a concern for him .

" Crime happens anywhere .
I 'm not going to tell you this is the safest place in Austin but it is a pretty calm place .
It 's not something people should be worried about , " said Sevilla .

Other restaurant employees KVUE spoke with did not want to be on camera , but said its not uncommon to see men sitting and drinking in the parking lot next to their restaurant .

Sources are told KVUE News that the gunman may have been at a nightclub or bar before the shooting so alcohol may be a factor .

Police said the gunman took off in a car after the shooting but was captured a short time later .
Police have not identified the man as of Sunday afternoon .

Sevilla told KVUE he 's not letting an isolated incident affect his sense of security .

" Whatever happens outside in the parking lot right next to us is not under our control .
What can we do ? " asked Sevilla .

He also wanted customers to know they have nothing to worry about .
