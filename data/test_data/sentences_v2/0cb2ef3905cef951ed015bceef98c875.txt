East Oakland : Baby shot in stroller expected to recover
OAKLAND -- A 1-year - old boy shot while riding in a stroller in East Oakland this week remained hospitalized Friday but was recovering , a police spokesman said .

Just after noon Thursday , the child 's father carried the baby into the Eastmont police substation on the 2600 block of 73rd Avenue and told officers his son had been shot .

The child , whose name was not released , was taken to a hospital and was in stable condition on Friday .

Police have not said how many times the boy was shot or where the wounds were located .
The child was with his family , being pushed in a stroller on the street when he was struck by the gunfire .

Police spokesman Frank Bonifacio said investigators continued to interview witnesses Friday to determine whether the shooting was accidental .
They were also investigating whether the boy was shot outside the police substation or outside his home on 73rd Avenue .

" This was unfortunate , and it 's going to be a long haul but thankfully the child is expected to recover , " Bonifacio said .
" We do have some witnesses who have not yet spoken to investigators and we 're looking into this being an accidental discharge .
We do n't think there 's any threat to that neighborhood .
They ( the family ) were not targeted . "

As of Friday , no suspects had been arrested in connection with the shooting .
