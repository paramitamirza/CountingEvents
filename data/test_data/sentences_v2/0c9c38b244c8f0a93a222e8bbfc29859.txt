‘ A monster scratched me’ : 4-year - old hit by stray bullet describes shooting
ANCHORAGE –

Hayley Francy was sleeping in her East Anchorage bedroom when a stray bullet hit her last week .

Anchorage police got called to the apartment on San Roberto Ave .
near Russian Jack Park just after midnight Thursday .
The four - year - old ’s mom , Jessyca Francy , said she came home from work to find her daughter ’s mattress covered in blood .
She took her daughter to the hospital , where she learned the bullet had missed Hayley ’s femoral artery by a quarter of an inch .
When police arrived at the apartment to investigate , officers found a bullet hole above Hayley ’s bed .

When asked about that night , she said a monster hurt her .
 “
A monster scratched me on the leg , ” she said .

Hayley spent two days in the hospital .
After being released , she refused to return to the apartment .

“ I don’t want to .
Mom had to find a new home , ” Hayley said , referring to the fact that Jessyca decided to move the family out of the apartment .
APD said the shot was fired from a gun in a third - floor apartment .
Officers interviewed someone in that unit , but no one has been charged with a crime .

“
There ’s a lot of domestic violence that comes from that house , ”
Francy said .
“
Whatever happened , I want the closure of knowing how this happened and for somebody to be held accountable .
”

Hayley has been staying with a family friend since she left the hospital .
The Francy family is trying to move out of its apartment , but is finding it difficult to find a new home because of Francy ’s criminal history .

“ I made a lot of mistakes in my past , ” she said .
“ It does make finding a place to rent hard . ”

Hayley is in good spirits , but has some difficulty walking .
She said her favorite thing to do is run , and she ’s hoping to be able to do it again sometime soon .

The family set up a GoFundMe account to help pay for the move and replacing Hayley ’s mattress .
