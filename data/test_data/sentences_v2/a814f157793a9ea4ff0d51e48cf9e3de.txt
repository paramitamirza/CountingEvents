City gets two counts dismissed in Zim Schwartze case
COLUMBIA —
The city got another shot at dismissing a civil rights lawsuit filed last year by former Emergency Management Director Zim Schwartze .

But a federal judge only granted partial victory for the city of Columbia , City Manager Mike Matthes and Columbia Police Department Chief Ken Burton on Tuesday .

U.S. District Court Judge Nanette Laughrey dismissed Schwartze 's claims that the city defamed her and stigmatized her when EMPTY she was fired in May 2012 EMPTY — but Laughrey left three counts in play for an Oct. 19 trial .

In her amended complaint , Schwartze said the defendants violated her due process rights , breached her employment contract and defamed her .

Schwartze , the Police Department 's first female captain , worked for the city for 20 years and accepted a written offer for the top job at Joint Communications on Oct. 6 , 2009 .

The offer , extended by EMPTY then - City Manager Bill Watkins , said she could be both emergency management director and a Police Department captain until she became eligible to receive her police pension in February 2012 , at which point she would have to pick one job or the other .

But on May 9 , 2012 , Matthes gave Schwartze an hour to EMPTY decide whether to resign or be terminated from her positions as director and captain , according to the lawsuit .

She chose the latter and was put on paid leave before the City Council amended the fiscal 2013 budget and eliminated her position .

Laughery dismissed the defamation count because Schwartze failed to show Matthes and Burton had " malicious intent " when they removed her as emergency management director .

Schwartze argued in the suit that the men 's belief that she was not " on board " with their management style and their treatment of her after termination were evidence of malicious intent , but Laughery called that argument insufficient .

Schwartze is now working as director of 911 emergency communications in Springfield , where she moved with her husband and children .

After she was fired , Schwartze was escorted from the Police Department building and locked out of her office .
Matthes sent an email to the mayor , the City Council and senior staff announcing her termination . EMPTY
Laughrey ruled that those acts did not reach the threshold of violating her due process rights .

Citing case law , Laughery wrote that " Schwartze has presented no evidence of Defendants ever accusing her of dishonesty , immorality , criminality , racism , or anything along those lines ...
Simply removing a terminated employee from the building or preventing access to records is not sufficient to infer such an accusation . "

But Schwartze 's other three counts allege that the defendants ignored city personnel policies and her October 2009 agreement when they fired her and failed to provide her with a chance to respond or appeal their decision .

Laughery wrote that Schwartze was entitled to due process before being terminated " for reasons other than a layoff " and that the city had yet to prove Schwartze 's termination was prompted by a lack of money or a need for the position , rather than another reason .

The case had cost the city $ 75,938.44 in legal fees and other expenses through July 2015 , City Counselor Nancy Thompson said .
More recent figures were unavailable Friday .

Wally Bley , one of three Columbia attorneys representing Schwartze , declined to discuss the lawsuit .

Attorneys for the defendants were unavailable for comment .
