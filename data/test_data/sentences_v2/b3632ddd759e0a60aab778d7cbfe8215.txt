L.A. fire destroys dozens of cars and vacant building
LOS ANGELES â€”
On Sunday , May 27 , 2007 at 2:21 PM , 23 Companies of Los Angeles Firefighters , 4 LAFD Rescue Ambulances , 1 Arson Unit , 2 Urban Search and Rescue Units , 1 Hazardous Materials Squad , 3 EMS Battalion Captains , 3 Battalion Chief Officer Command Teams and 1 Division Chief Officer Command Team , a total of 147 Los Angeles Fire Department personnel , responded to a Major Emergency Structure Fire at a new car storage yard near 4602 Brazil Street in the Atwater Village area of Los Angeles .

The aforementioned LAFD personnel were joined in Automatic Aid by 5 Engine Companies , 1 Truck Company and a Battalion Chief from the neighboring Glendale Fire Department , and 1 Battalion Chief from the nearby Burbank Fire Department .
All responders operated under the Unified Command of LAFD Assistant Chief Terrance Manning and Glendale Fire Department Battalion Chief Robert Doyle .

First to arrive Los Angeles Firefighters quickly navigated the remote portion of an industrial district to discover a vacant and aging one - story 50 ' x 100 ' commercial structure fully involved , with flames extending to vegetation , rubbish and densely stored new vehicles nearby .

In a well - coordinated defensive operation , master hose streams were swiftly focused on the decrepit wooden structure , as flames fanned by 10 mile - per - hour winds took hold of unkempt and highly flammable vegetation , including palm trees as much as a quarter - mile away .

The wind - driven embers drove fire north and east to the Los Angeles River , as teams of Firefighters worked multiple handlines on the distant flames , paying close heed to a busy adjacent railroad and high - voltage electrical lines above portions of the fire .

Simultaneously , their colleagues sought to prevent rapid fire spread among dozens of closely parked vehicles stored bumper - to - bumper near the burning building .

Weakened by the blaze , the ramshackle structure collapsed as a total loss .
Despite the efforts of Firefighters , a total of 53 new passenger vehicles , including several sedans destined for livery service , were damaged or destroyed by fire .

During the intense battle against the flames , one Los Angeles Firefighter sustained a sizeable laceration to his left hand .
He was transported in good condition to Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center , where he was treated and released to remain off - duty .

No other injuries were reported .

Firefighter/Heavy Equipment Operators from the LAFD Tractor Company assisted with the prolonged overhaul of smoldering debris .

Monetary loss from the fire is still being tabulated .
Though witnesses place fire origin in close proximity to the vacant structure , the specific cause of the blaze remains categorized as " under investigation " .
