 Police in San Francisco scoured the city Saturday , searching for killers who gunned down four men in what likely was a gang - related attack in Hayes Valley late Friday .

Police Chief Greg Suhr said Saturday that police gang task force and homicide units are combining efforts so they can act quickly to counter any possible gang retaliation .

“ We need to figure out why this happened .
If we can discover that , then we will know if there is another shoe that is going to fall , ” Suhr said .
“ We need to be out in front of that .
Authorities do not believe the public is in danger in the thriving neighborhood known for its boutiques and popular restaurants .

Right now it looks like an all - out assault on these guys , ” said Lt .
Toney Chaplin of the San Francisco Police Department homicide detail .
It ’s hard to pin down ” what might have motivated the attack , he said .

He said the victims were all adults in their 20s .
Officers have stepped up patrols around the area , and the gang task force is joining SFPD ’s Northern Station to saturate the area .
 “
We’re definitely making sure there is a high presence out there , a high visibility , ” Chaplin said .

The victims were found shot at about 10 p.m. in a stolen black 2005 Honda that was double - parked near the corner of Laguna and Page streets , police said .
All four men died at the scene .

While Suhr said police know the identity of the victims , their names were not immediately released .
One victim was identified Saturday by his aunt , Kim Barnett , who drove to San Francisco from near Sacramento to view the scene of the crime Saturday .

She said her nephew was Manuel O’Neal , who was in his early 20s .
She insisted he wasn’t in a gang .
He was a very good kid , very intelligent , smart and caring , ” she said .
It hurts .
He traveled the whole country with my family .
Barnett said O’Neal has been in and out of school in recent months and traveled from the Sacramento area to visit his mother in San Francisco .

One resident , who did not want to be named but said he watched police perform CPR on the victims late Friday , said ,
“ It was very surreal to watch .
He said he heard police telling one of the victims , “
We’re trying to help you .
Let us help you . ”

Susan O’Connell was in bed and was startled by the sound of gunfire .

I heard what sounded like grenades go off , ” she said .
I’ve never been that close to gunfire .
Late Friday , yellow tarps covered the bodies of the victims around the sedan parked on Laguna Street near the curb , pointed toward Market Street .
The car still had its amber lights and taillights on .
Yellow evidence markers were strewn around the car .

Suhr said four guns were likely involved in the massacre , with two guns found inside the stolen car with the victims .

Two different calibers of shell casings were recovered on the ground near the car , and multiple shots were fired , he added .

“ We’ve got four victims in a car here , ”
one of the first officers who arrived at the scene said on the police radio .
“ We’ve got multiple gunshot wounds here , ” another officer reported .

After dispatchers asked whether it was safe for paramedics to enter the area , an officer responded , “
It is clear for them to come in .
Get them in here quick , please . ”

No arrests have been made .
San Francisco police described a possible suspect vehicle as a newer - model silver Scion that could have been heading toward Highway 101 .
California Highway Patrol officers were alerted .

Police are also searching for any street surveillance video that might have caught either the attack or the fleeing car .

Residents who called 911 reported hearing as many as 15 shots .
The gunfire was also captured by ShotSpotter , the city ’s gunfire - detection system .
Bullets hit at least one parked car .

“ We thought it was firecrackers at first , but then we heard the police , ” said neighbor Robin Levitt , 62 .

On Saturday morning , Victoria Austin , 61 , a priest at the nearby San Francisco Zen Center , put up a memorial on a post that said , “
1/9/15/ drive - by 4 people rest in peace , ” with flowers attached .

I was awakened by sounds , saw the flashing lights , ” she said .
“ I had hoped violence and the causes of violence in the neighborhood were done .
It ’s not over .
It ’s a shock to everyone .
Officers cordoned off several blocks with yellow crime scene tape and canvassed the neighborhood for witnesses .
Neighbors gathered at the tape , hoping the four victims were not their loved ones .

We’re just trying to make sure everybody ’s kids are OK , ” said a woman who asked to be identified only as Toni .
I just don’t want to get that phone call .
On Saturday morning , news of the killings was reverberating through the busy shopping district along Hayes Street , three blocks north of the crime scene .
Shoppers dipped into clothing stores while dozens waited in line for brunch at the district ’s many restaurants .

Donald Simms , 47 , manager of the men ’s clothing store Sean , said , “
Random violence can happen anywhere .
It doesn’t affect my perception of the neighborhood .
The killings added to a grim start to the new year in San Francisco , which reported 45 homicides in 2014 .

On Wednesday , a man died after being shot near Candlestick Park .
Last Sunday evening , two police sergeants shot and killed a despondent man who allegedly pointed an Airsoft replica gun at them outside SFPD ’s Mission Station .

Authorities urged anyone with information on the killings to call San Francisco police at ( 415 ) 575 - 4444 or text a tip to TIP411 with “ SFPD ” at the beginning of the message .
