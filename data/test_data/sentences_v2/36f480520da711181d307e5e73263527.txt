Erie police , specifically the two lead detectives , Rick Lorah and Greg Baney , were commended for their hard work during a news conference Friday morning .

" Hunting down leads , sending out evidence , going back to crime scene , day in and day out working this case .
I do n't think we 'd be here today had they paused for a moment and turned their attention elsewhere , " said Erie County District Attorney Jack Daneri .
" I would hope as this case moves forward , the public 's confidence in the police , should it have waned over the last 8 or 9 months , would certainly be restored . "
