On Saturday , December 1 , at 4:40 AM , 16 Companies of Los Angeles Firefighters , 4 LAFD Rescue Ambulances , 1 Arson Unit , 1 Hazardous Materials Team , 2 EMS Battalion Captains , 5 Battalion Chief Officer Command Teams , and 1 Division Chief Officer Command Team , all under the direction of Assistant Chief Terrance Manning responded to a Major Emergency Structure Fire at 1770 N. El Cerrito Pl .
in Hollywood .

Firefighters arrived to find a vacant , 3-story apartment building , approximately 100 ' x 150 ' with heavy fire on all three floors .
Firefighters immediately began an aggressive interior attack coordinated with rooftop ventilation .
Even though this was a vacant apartment building , as Firefighters advanced through the structure , they conducted a primary search looking for anyone who may have been inside .
Fortunately , no one was discovered during the search and no injuries were reported .

Firefighting efforts proved challenging and dangerous when holes were discovered in the floors throughout the structure .
In addition , ventilation efforts were extended due to the building having a 2 " lightweight concrete roof .
Using a well coordinated attack , 75 Firefighters were able to control the fire in just under one hour .
The cause of the fire is under investigation and the dollar loss is still being tabulated .
