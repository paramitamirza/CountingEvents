When kids shoot themselves in Georgia , who 's responsible ?
The children ’s tragic deaths , just one month apart , were eerily similar and totally preventable .

Last Saturday morning , 6-year - old Ja’Mecca Smith discovered a loaded gun between two sofa cushions in her family ’s Peoplestown apartment .
Her father , Demarqo Smith , four of her siblings and another adult were home at the time , but no one saw the little girl with the gap - tooth smile point the gun at her head and pull the trigger .

On Oct. 27 , 2-year - old Waylon Dennington found his father ’s semi - automatic handgun resting in a holster on his parents’ bed .
His father , Grant Dennington , was in the bathroom when the gun discharged , killing Waylon on the scene .

The similarities end there .
Though the gun did not belong to him , Demarqo Smith was charged with involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct for placing the firearm under the sofa cushion , Atlanta police said .

Grant Dennington , meanwhile , will not be charged , Acworth Police Chief Wayne Dennard told The Atlanta Journal - Constitution .

 “
There ’s nothing specific in Georgia law that guides us when it comes to bringing criminal charges , ” said Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds .

Adults are criminally liable in Georgia only when they intentionally or knowingly provide a child access to a handgun .
Fourteen states , and the District of Columbia have laws prohibiting negligent storage .

According to the Centers For Disease Control and Preventon ’s public health database , 69 children under the age of 15 died from unintentional gunfire in 2013 , the latest year for which such data is available .

In the past six weeks alone , four children have died in or near metro Atlanta from unintentional gunshot wounds .

On Oct. 17 , 8-year - old Sharia Lynch was killed inside her family ’s Paulding County home .
Her mother , Marsha , told investigators a handgun had fallen and discharged when it hit the floor , striking Sharia in the head .
A Paulding police spokesman said the case will be taken before a grand jury next month .

Last month , Jayden Jamar Clay was shot and killed after finding a .45-caliber handgun while playing with his twin brother inside their Butts County home .
His mother ’s boyfriend , Christopher Dwayne Askins , was later charged with second - degree cruelty to children and possession of a gun by a convicted felon .

Had it not been illegal for him to possess a gun , Askins would likely not have been charged , said Vivian Goldenberg of the Georgia chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America , which advocates “ common - sense gun reforms .
When there are charges it ’s usually because of other circumstances , ” Goldenberg said .
“ We are giving gun owners a special privilege .
Negligence is a form of child abuse .
The National Rifle Association has consistently opposed safe storage laws , arguing they compromise a gun owner ’s security by providing criminals a clear advantage in home invasions .

Grant Dennington , according to Chief Dennard , was a responsible gun owner .
What happened Oct. 27 at his Acworth home was a tragic exception , Dennard said .

Dennington had just picked up his two sons who were staying with a relative .
He went to the bathroom right after they returned home , placing his gun on his bed .
 “
We’re talking a minute or two , ”
Dennard said .
“ We spent a lot of time talking to the dad , interviewing other family members .
This was not routine on his part .
He always took the necessary precautions .
Atlanta police would not discuss their reasoning for charging Demarqo Smith , currently being held in Fulton County Jail .
After the shooting Smith briefly left the home , about a mile from Turner Field , but returned to speak with detectives .
Public records revealed no convictions that would prohibit Smith from owning a gun .
 “
It ’s often comes down to a judgment call , ” Reynolds , the Cobb DA , said .
“ You’ve got to lay all the facts on the table and determine was this behavior rising to reckless conduct or just a tragic mistake . ”
 “
There ’s a human element involved , too , ” he said , referencing the Dennington case .
What good can come from prosecuting this father ?
But Goldenberg said there should be consequences to parental negligence .

There needs to be a way to hold people accountable or this situation is going to continue to repeat , ” she said .
