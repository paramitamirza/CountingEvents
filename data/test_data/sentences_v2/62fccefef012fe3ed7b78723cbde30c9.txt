On prosecuting gun - owning parents when children accidentally shoot and kill
In Arkansas this November , within about a week of each other , two unintentional self - inflicted firearm deaths occurred at the hands of a two and six year old .

Six - year - old Eron Burks found a loaded gun on the floor of the car his aunt was driving and shot himself in the face .
His aunt has been charged with manslaughter .

A 2-year - old got his hands on a gun in his uncle â€™s home and shot himself in the head .
His parents have been charged with manslaughter .

However , in South Carolina , a 24 year - old great aunt was charged with unlawfully carrying a pistol when her nephew shot his grandmother , not fatally , in the back after finding a gun in the pocket of the passenger seat in the car they were all driving in .
