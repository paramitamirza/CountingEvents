 ST. LOUIS COUNTY , MO ( KTVI)- Two young St. Louis County boys are dead along with their father in a heartbreaking apparent murder/suicide .
Lt . Col .
Ken Cox with St. Louis County Police says it started in Franklin County earlier in the day Saturday , when a warrant was issued for the arrest of Christopher Cadenbach , 43 , on domestic violence charges in Franklin County .

Christopher Cadenbach had spent the day with his sons , five - year old Ethan and four - year old Owen Cadenbach , and his own mother at a park .
When they returned to a home in the 300 block of Rauhut in south St. Louis County , Cadenbach took the mother ’s car and the kids and left .

Cadenbach ’s mother contacted police and that led to the issuance of the Amber Alert .

A St. Louis County Park ranger was closing Cliff Cave County Park around 8:00pm Saturday and noticed the car that was wanted by police and called authorities .

The County police helicopter was up , spotted the car , and saw someone moving towards it .
Police officers responded and when they arrived , shots were heard .
They believe that was when Christopher Cadenback was shooting his own children .
Both boys were dead when police reached the car .

The officers then engaged Cadenbach and that ’s when Cadenbach reportedly took his own life .

Police are continuing to investigate the incident .
Cadenbach was estranged from his wife .

Cliff Cave Park will be closed Sunday .
