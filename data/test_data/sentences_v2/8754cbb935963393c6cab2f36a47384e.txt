Ali Syed ’s Southern California shooting spree : 3 victims identified as Courtney Aoki , Mel Edwards , Jeremy Lewis
The shotgun - wielding student shot Edwards 3 times , execution - style , and killed plumber Lewis in a Tustin parking lot .
Aoki was the first victim of Syed , who cops described as a loner who " spent a lot of time alone in his room playing video games . "

The first victim of the swift - moving shooting spree that terrorized southern California Tuesday and claimed four lives was an aspiring actress whose connection to the gunman was not immediately clear , authorities said Wednesday .

Courtney Aoki , 20 , was shot multiple times and left for dead around 4:45 a.m. Tuesday in the residence that shotgun - wielding madman Ali Syed shared with his parents , police said .

Cops said they could n't confirm a report Aoki worked as a stripper .

" We 're still trying to figure out their relationship , " Gail Krause , a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff told the Daily News .
" We have not identified an occupation ( for Aoki ) . "

Syed , an unemployed part - time community college student who committed suicide after his bloody hour - long rampage , was a loner , cops said .

" He spent a lot of time alone in his room playing video games , " Sheriff 's spokesman Jim Amormino said .

Amormino said the suspect left " no evidence , no note , nothing that would explain this very bizarre , violent behavior . "

Syed 's one - man crime wave started in the pre - dawn hours Tuesday with a 12-gauge shotgun purchased by his father , cops said .

The gunman killed Aoki in cold blood and then fled the family 's Ladera Ranch residence as his parents called 911 , authorities said .

He killed two more people during carjackings , injured at least three more with wild , random shooting along his 25- mile trail of carnage and ultimately shot himself in the head when cornered by California Highway Patrol , authorities said .

His other two murder victims were a beloved father of two and young plumber known for his easy smile .

Victim Melvin Edwards , 69 , was apparently picked at random for his white BMW as he waited at a stop sign in Santa Ana , Calif. , authorities said .

Syed ordered Edwards out of his vehicle at gunpoint , marched him to a curb and shot him three times execution - style , witnesses told police .

" The family is still processing the shock and grief of the whole event , " Edwards ' brother - in - law Jeff Osborn told the Daily News Wednesday .
" He was a great dad and a great friend . "

In a statement from the family , Edwards was described as an avid Dodgers fan and accomplished fly fisherman .

The Laguna Hills resident also was a Vietnam vet who ran a small aerospace machinery company with his son Ryan , 36 .

 " He was a devoted husband , father and grandfather and was always generous with his time and heart , " the statement said .
" He carried himself with great dignity and civility , and lived by example . "

Syed claimed his last victim , 26-year - old plumber Jeremy Lewis , in a parking lot near a hotel construction site in Tustin .

The plumbing project 's foreman ran toward the shooting to intervene and came face to face with Syed , who purportedly made cryptic comments about the drug industry , the foreman told KNBC.
 "
He said this was a result of the drug industry , the narcotics industry , and that it did n't matter because he 'd be dead in 20 minutes , " foreman Shane Caporaso said .
" I just started running and got lucky . "

Syed shot at Caporaso twice , hitting him once in the arm , KNBC reported .

He described Lewis as always smiling and joking .

" Everybody 's missing Jeremy , " Caporaso said .

After allegedly killing Lewis , Syed took one of the construction trucks and fled to nearby Orange , this time with California Highway Patrol officers in pursuit .

He jumped from the moving utility truck at an intersection in Orange around 5:55 a.m. and shot himself in the head , police said .

" There really was n't a confrontation at the very end , " Tustin Police Chief Scott Jordan said .
" It happened so quickly . "

A shotgun was recovered at the scene and is believed to be the only weapon used .

Syed had no criminal record .

Syed 's parents told police they did not know the young woman killed inside their home .

" Our son lives with us and I think they got into a fight or something and we heard a gunshot , " his dad told a 911 dispatcher in a call released Wednesday .
" My son is younger , he sometimes has friends over .
I do n't know all the details at this point . "

The dad said the son fled the house soon after the shots were fired .

" We were asleep , we heard something , it sounded like a gunshot , " the dad said .
" I do n't know .
I did n't want to get involved .
...
I have not gone in his room .
I do n't know what 's going on . "
