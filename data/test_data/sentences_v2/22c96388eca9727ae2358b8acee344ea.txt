DUNCANNON , Pa. ( WHTM ) –
Police say a 12-year - old girl is the victim of a fatal shooting during an apartment eviction attempt Monday morning .

She was pronounced dead at the scene .
An autopsy is scheduled Wednesday .

Pennsylvania State Constable Clarke Steele was at the Pfautz Apartments on Rebecca Drive in Penn Township with an eviction order for Meyer and his family .
Police said Meyer opened the door and shut it .
He then reopened the door and exchanged words with the constable before leveling a loaded .223 caliber rifle that had been slung and concealed along his body , police said .

With the rifle pointed directly at his chest , police said Steele , who was in uniform , unholstered his .40 caliber duty handgun and fired one shot .

Police said employees of the apartment complex were on scene for the eviction and witnessed the incident .
