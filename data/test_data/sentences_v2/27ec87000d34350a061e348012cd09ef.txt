 Twenty - year - old Jordan Clay was taken into custody in Breaux Bridge in connection with the Bourbon Street shooting .

The second suspect in the Bourbon Street shooting has been arrested in Lafayette .

Police say that Travon Manuel of Lafayette was arrested at his home .
Louisiana State Police detained Manuel without incident .
Officials say he will be extradited to New Orleans to face charges of second degree murder and nine counts of attempted murder .

Authorities arrested the first Lafayette Parish man on a count of second - degree murder in Sunday 's shooting on Bourbon Street that left one man dead and nine injured .

St. Martin Parish officials took Jordan Clay , 20 , into custody in Breaux Bridge , said New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison .

Clay , who has a pending court case in Lafayette Parish on one count of possessing a stolen firearm , will be extradited to New Orleans to face prosecution .

Harrison said authorities are " aggressively " searching for a second suspect from the Lafayette area , although that person 's name has not been released .
Both Clay and the second suspect had been in New Orleans for the annual Bayou Classic football game between Grambling State and Southern Universities .

Harrison said the Lafayette suspects were out - of - towners with no affiliation with either university .
Authorities believe Clay and the victim had known each other for a while and had an " ongoing dispute . "

Demontris Toliver , 25 , of New Orleans , died in the early Sunday shooting , while nine others suffered life - threatening injuries .
Toliver 's father appeared in tears beside New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and law enforcement authorities during a Friday morning press conference .

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he 's meeting with law enforcement officials to discuss how to better address gun violence issues .

" This is a systemic problem that requires a robust response , " not only in New Orleans , but throughout the state and country , Landrieu said .

Hundreds of thousands of people had descended upon New Orleans over the weekend for the Bayou Classic , Saints game and the Thanksgiving holiday , Landrieu said .
