 A 26-year - old woman was shot to death while driving in Milwaukee on Tuesday morning and the shot came from a child in the back seat who somehow got hold of a gun .

The woman was struck once in the back as she drove south on Highway 175 near W. Vliet St. , at the southwest end of Washington Park , about 10:30 a.m. , the Milwaukee County Sheriff 's Office said .

The woman was not breathing and had no pulse when deputies arrived .
Officials began CPR but she was pronounced dead at the scene .

A sheriff 's spokeswoman said late Tuesday afternoon that detectives were interviewing witnesses .
The age and gender of the child were not released .
She did not know the relationship between the woman and the child , whether the child was in a car seat , what type of weapon was used or how the child managed to get a gun and fire it .

WISN - TV ( Channel 12 ) identified the woman as Patrice Price , a mother of three , who was driving her boyfriend 's car .
The boyfriend is a security guard and left his weapon in the car , WISN reported .
Andre Price told WISN that his daughter was accidentally shot by her 2-year - old son .

Video from the scene showed a blue four - door sedan pulled to the side of the southbound lanes .
Brandon Glass was traveling north on Highway 175 when he realized something was wrong on the other side of the freeway , he told WTMJ - TV ( Channel 4 ) .
" I saw a blue sedan that had its door open and it was stopped in the middle of the freeway .
And I saw a body lying outside of that , " said Glass .

Another witness told Fox 6 News she saw bystanders rushing to the car .

" People were panicking and you could tell people were generally trying to help , " said Kourtney Blevins .
" I know there 's some little boys down there , which they put in a police car .
It was two little boys .
It looked like some kids were involved , unfortunately . "

The southbound lanes of Highway 175 were shut down Tuesday for several hours during the incident , reopening about 1:45 p.m.
 Last month in Florida , a woman was shot in the back while driving when her 4-year - old son picked up a .45-caliber handgun .
Jamie Gilt , 31 , survived the shooting .
Gilt , a pro - gun activist , legally owned the firearm and maintained a Facebook page called " Jamie Gilt for Gun Sense . "

Law enforcement officials said Gilt had placed the unholstered gun under the front seat and it slid out as she pulled a horse trailer to pick up a horse .
The toddler unbuckled his seat , picked up the gun and fired it at his mother .
