Gunman kills six in drive - by shooting in California college town
SANTA BARBARA , California A gunman killed six people and wounded seven others in a drive - by shooting in a Southern California college town , spraying bullets from his car until it crashed and he was found dead inside , authorities said on Saturday .

Authorities were investigating a possible link between the Friday night shooting in the town of Isla Vista near the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara and a threatening video posted online .

In the YouTube video , which Santa Barbara Sheriff Bill Brown said appears to have been made by the suspected gunman , a young man bitterly complains of loneliness and rejection by women and says he plans to kill people .

Witnesses to the violence reported seeing someone driving a black BMW through the streets and shooting at people in Isla Vista , a beachside community where many college students live .

" It 's obviously the work of a madman , " Brown told a news conference .
" There 's going to be a lot more information that will come out that will give a clearer picture of just how disturbed this individual was . "
 Seven people died in the rampage , including the suspect , Brown said .
Brown has not publicly named the suspect but a lawyer for the suspected gunman 's family tentatively identified him as Elliot Rodger , son of a Hollywood director .

" I can not confirm that but we believe it , " the attorney , Alan Shifman , told reporters outside the family home in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles .
" But the police would not give us 100 percent ( certainty ) . "

" We offer our deepest , compassionate sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy , " Shifman told reporters , reading from a prepared statement on behalf of the family .
" We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain and our hearts go out to everyone involved . "

The suspected gunman 's father was Peter Rodger , an assistant director on 2012 film " The Hunger Games . "

The New York Times quoted Shifman as saying that Rodger 's parents had called the police about a month ago to express concerns about his YouTube videos " regarding suicide and the killing of people . "
The newspaper quoted Shifman as saying police officers had interviewed Rodger but concluded he posed no danger .
Shifman said they had found him to be a
" perfectly polite , kind and wonderful human , " the Times said .

Brown said deputies had twice exchanged fire with the suspected gunman on Friday night before his vehicle crashed and the suspect was found dead inside of a gunshot wound to the head .
Brown could not say if he was killed by deputies or died of a self - inflicted wound .

A semi - automatic handgun was recovered from the scene , Brown said .

California 's KEYT - TV reported that the suspected gunman 's apartment complex was also a crime scene and that three bodies had been removed from the site .
Authorities could not immediately confirm the report and there was no immediate word whether the bodies were included in the existing death toll .

POPULAR KIDS

The YouTube video police were studying showed a young man who identified himself as Elliot Rodger pouring out his hatred of women who have rejected him and " popular kids , " and threatening to kill people out of loneliness and sexual frustration .

" You girls have never been attracted to me .
I do n't know why you girls are n't attracted to me .
But I will punish you all for it .
It 's an injustice , a crime , " he said in the video , his speech punctuated by bursts of laughter .

The video appeared to have been uploaded to YouTube on Friday night , shortly before the shooting .
" It would appear that is connected , " Brown said .

YouTube has since removed the video , posting in its place a notice saying it violated its terms of service .
A spokeswoman for Google , which owns YouTube , was not available for comment .

The identities of those killed in the rampage were withheld pending notification of their families , and there was no immediate word on the condition of the wounded .

But Richard Martinez told reporters that his 20-year - old son Christopher , a UCSB English major who wanted to go to law school , was killed while buying his dinner in a deli store that came under fire by the gunman .

" Why did Chris die ?
Chris died because of craven , irresponsible politicians and the NRA , " an emotional Martinez told reporters outside the Santa Barbara County Sheriff 's Office .
" They talk about gun rights , what about Chris ' right to live ?
When will this insanity stop ? "

" POPPING NOISES "

Robert Johnson , a 21-year - old UCSB student , said he first noticed trouble after a car drove past him at a busy Isla Vista intersection and he then heard " popping noises " that he originally mistook for firecrackers or the car backfiring .
 "
Then the sound came again , and by that point it had pulled up in front of a convenience store deli , and someone in the car was firing into a crowd of about eight , 10 people that were gathered in front of the store , " he said .

" Everyone that was being fired upon , they all jumped and scrambled to run inside the store , " he said .

The car had darkly tinted windows and the occupant was not visible , Johnson said .

College student Brad Martin told a UCSB student newspaper that his girlfriend was " absolutely hysterical " after being approached by the gunman with a weapon she initially was not sure was real .

"
She said the next second he raised it up to her face ... and she turned around and started running , " Martin told the Daily Nexus .
" That 's when she heard ' bang , bang , bang ' right behind her as she was running . "

University of California President Janet Napolitano , formerly U.S. secretary of Homeland Security , said she was " shocked and deeply saddened " by the shooting near the campus .

" Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of this tragedy , their families and the entire Santa Barbara community , " she said in a statement .

The incident was the latest mass shooting in the United States , where schools , shopping malls and military bases have been scenes of such crimes .

Last month , a gunman killed three people and himself at the Fort Hood U.S. Army base in Texas , where another gunman killed 13 people in 2009 .

In December 2012 , 20 children and six adults were killed in a mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown , Connecticut .
Six months before that , a gunman killed 14 people in a Denver - area movie theater .

The deadliest U.S. mass shooting in modern times was in 2007 , when a student at Virginia Tech killed 32 people in a shooting spree .

Some 23,000 people live in Isla Vista .
Many are students at UCSB , which has an enrollment of about 22,000 , or at Santa Barbara City College .
