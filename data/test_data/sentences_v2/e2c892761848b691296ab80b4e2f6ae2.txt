 CHICAGO â€”
A mass shooting during the filming of a rap video in an Auburn Gresham park early Tuesday left one man dead , four wounded and police searching for the killer , possibly with the help of the video that was rolling .

The chaos played out at 2:19 a.m. in Foster Park , in the 1400 block of West 84th Street .
Someone walked up , fired shots and ran off , said Officer Ana Pacheco , a Chicago Police spokeswoman .

A 23-year - old man was shot in the back of his head and was pronounced dead at the scene , Pacheco said .
He was identified as Damond Dawson , of the 8400 block of South Justine , by the Cook County Medical Examiner 's Office .
Dawson was pronounced dead at 4:10 a.m.

A 19-year - old woman was shot in her groin and was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in serious condition , Pacheco said .

Three others were listed as " stable " at Advocate Christ Medical Center after the shooting : A 20-year - old man was shot in his leg and shoulder , a 25-year - old man had his left leg grazed by a bullet and an 18-year - old man 's back was grazed by a bullet , Pacheco said .

The incident was possibly gang - related , police said .

No one was in custody .

The rapper recording the video , who performs under the name ForeignLyfe , told reporters he heard " my homie say , ' Somebody 's pulling up . '

" We turned around and looked back .
Quick as we looked back they started shooting , " he said .

The camera was on him when the shooting started , he said .
" So at that point everybody ran , scattered , going their separate ways , " he said .

An aunt told reporters on the scene that she had warned her nephew to stay out of the park because of late - night gunfire in the area is common .
She described the victim as a high school dropout but not a gang member .
Dawson " was a good guy who would do anything for you , " she said .

WGN - TV reported that Dawson was also a rapper known as Thugga .
