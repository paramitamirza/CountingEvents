When Firefighters arrived on scene , they were immediately confronted with heavy fire through the roof of a single - story commercial building , approximately 70 ' x 125 ' .
As hoselines were being extended into the interior of the structure , it was noted that the building was placarded as potentially having hazardous materials stored inside .
A decision was made to withdraw Firefighters from the interior attack and progress into a defensive firefighting effort to contain the spread of the fire and prevent damage surrounding buildings .

Firefighters were able to contain the fire in one hour to the building of origin , doing business as " Active Magnetic Inspection Inc. " , an aircraft parts plating company .
LAFD Hazardous Materials teams , in concert with a L.A. County Health Hazardous Material unit are currently evaluating the runoff for possible contaminates .
Preliminary tests indicate that there are no chemical hazards .
One Firefighter suffered second - degree burns to his hand , was evaluated at Sherman Oaks Hospital , and placed off duty .
The cause of the fire is under investigation and the dollar loss is still being tabulated .
