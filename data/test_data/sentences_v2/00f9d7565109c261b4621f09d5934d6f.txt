Shot that killed 7-year - old boy in Humboldt Park meant for his dad , police say
A 7-year - old boy was shot and killed Saturday night while celebrating the Fourth of July with his family on the city 's West Side , and Sunday evening Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said that the bullet that killed Amari Brown was meant for his father .
McCarthy said Antonio Brown , who he referred to as a " ranking gang member , " was the intended target of the attack and that he is not cooperating with investigators .
Amari was standing with an unrelated 26-year - old woman on the sidewalk in the 1100-block of North Harding Avenue in the Humboldt Park neighborhood just before midnight Saturday when shots rang out .
He was shot in the right side of the chest and taken by his father to Cook County Hospital , where he died .
The woman was also shot in the chest and is hospitalized in stable condition .
Amari 's grieving mother , Amber Hailey , could not be comforted as her family made a plea for the person who gunned down her son to turn themselves in."You might as well turn yourself in because this 7-year - old , our family member , did nothing to you , " Deirdre Holman said .
The child 's family made their demand during a Sunday afternoon prayer vigil on the sidewalk of the Humboldt Park neighborhood where the boy was killed."This person was killed by someone who looks like us , who walks like us , who dresses like us , who lives among us , " said Rev. Ira Acree .
Pastors with the Leaders Network pledged $ 1,000 for information leading to an arrest."None of us will be safe until all of these children are safe , " said Rev. Marshall Hatch .
The soon - to - be second grader was one of several dozen weekend shooting victims in the city .
By mid - afternoon Sunday , at least seven people had been killed in Chicago and 40 wounded in 33 separate shooting incidents since Friday .
Among those hit by bullets was 17-year - old Vonzell Banks , who was honored Sunday at the South Side church where he played the drums .
Banks was shot and killed Friday at a park named for another slain teen , Hadiya Pendleton."In the last 48 hours , Chicago police officers have recovered about one illegal gun per hour across our city , " McCarthy said .
While displaying some of those guns , Supt .
McCarthy said there was a move to increase manpower this weekend by putting officers on 12-hour shifts .
He said the bullet that killed 7-year - old Amari Brown was intended for Antonio Brown."His father is ranking gang member with 45 previous arrests , " said McCarthy .
" I do n't know how many pages ( his arrest record ) is
, it 's probably 22 pages long .
( He was )
arrested for a firearms in April , on the street the very next day .
If Mr. Brown is in custody , his son is alive."McCarthy said the case of Amari 's father highlights the need for tougher punishment for alleged gun offenders .
