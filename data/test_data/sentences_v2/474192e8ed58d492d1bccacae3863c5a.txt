Neighborhood leaders call for an end to violence after shooting at a Toledo after - hours lounge
It 's an after - hours party that police say turned violent .

At least three people were taken to the hospital after an early morning shooting outside a lounge called The Underground .

" Right now we need to do something , you know what I mean , and get that neighborhood back up , " said Soul City Boxing Gym owner Roshawn Jones .

His gym sits across the street from that lounge .

Jones says he 's tired of the constant violence that he says plagues the area near his neighborhood business .

" It 's hard to make money over there , you know what I mean , and stay afloat because , like I said , people do n't want to come over there when you have , you know , shootings , " said Jones .
" Businesses do n't want to invest over there because they know bad things are going to happen . "

In the aftermath , bullet ridden vehicles line the parking lot where the shooting happened .
And community leaders say while the neighborhood has improved over the years , seeing things like this are still troubling .

" They want to do what they want to do , that 's alright .
But when people get shot , that 's a tragedy , " said Rev. Ronald Taylor .

He serves as pastor of Beulah Missionary Baptist Church located right next to the scene of the shooting .

He wants whoever fired the shots to know they 're not only impacting the lives of the victims , but also those of family members .

" That 's somebody 's daughter , somebody 's son , " said Taylor .
" Somebody 's child got shot last night .
I do n't care who you are , somebody 's going to feel the pain of that . "

After Sunday 's shooting , these community leaders hope the neighborhood can come together to put an end to violence like this .

Detectives say they do n't have any motives or leads on a suspect at this point .
