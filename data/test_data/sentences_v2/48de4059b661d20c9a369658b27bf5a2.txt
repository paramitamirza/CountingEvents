The city of Anadarko is struggling to make sense of four recent suicides involving young people in their town .

“ They 've been violent and they 've really shook the community to the core , ” said Anadarko Police Chief Jason Smith .

The latest suicide happened Tuesday involving an 11-year - old boy .
Chief Smith is trying to come up with a plan to address what is happening and asks for the community ’s support .
He said staying silent is helping anyone .
 “
Not talking about the last three did n't prevent the fourth one , ”
Smith told News 9 .

Smith said there have been four suicides involving young people in the last seven weeks and all of them used a gun .

The first was 16-year - old sophomore Jaidon DuBois .
His father , Jamie DuBois , allowed News 9 to use his son ’s name and pictures .
DuBois said Jaidon fought with depression and the family watched it closely , taking him to a counselor and making sure he was taking his medicines .
He said Jaidon seemed to be doing well lately , but DuBois believes Jaidon had an inner depression that he just could not overcome .

The other deaths involved a 21-year - old , a 22-year - old and the most recent was an 11-year - old .

After the 11-year - old ’s suicide , Anadarko Police wrote about it on their Facebook page and addressed the suicides for the first time .

Chief Smith is a 20-year veteran and said he has never seen anything like it .

“
Never this many this close together that seem to be unrelated , ” Chief Smith explained .

He specified that they were unrelated as far as the cause .
While they search for answers , the city , police and Anadarko Public Schools are working together with the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services to make sure resources are available .

“ I want them to know that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem , ” Smith said .
“ Life gets so much better , ” he added .

A community Care Station will be open for all interested January 20 and January 21 .
Services will be available at The Physicians Hospital in Anadarko between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. , and again from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.

Services are available for anyone impacted by the recent events , those who are experiencing thoughts of suicide or self - harm , or persons seeking help for mental health or substance abuse concerns .

Assistance is available for those unable to access the “ Care Station ” by calling 1 - 800 - 273-TALK ( 8255 ) .
