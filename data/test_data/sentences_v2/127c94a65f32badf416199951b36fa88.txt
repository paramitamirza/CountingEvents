The incident happened at East Grand and Blair in the College Hill neighborhood at 8 p.m. Saturday near the Grand Avenue Water Tower .

Police said the boy was riding in a car with his father and another man when they were attempting to make a left turn on Grand from Interstate 70 when a Toyota Avalon allegedly driven by William Hampton almost struck them .
