Police : 4 teens shot at Statesville birthday party
By Eric Philips
 Investigators in Iredell County are trying to track down whoever opened fire on a crowd of hundreds of teens over the weekend .

Four teens attending a birthday party at the American Legion in Statesville were struck by bullets , including 19-year - old Christopher Campbell .

" I did n't know what the intentions was , I just know I was hit , " Campbell said .

He is on crutches after being shot in the leg at the hall on Wallace Springs Road .
He said bullets started flying and he was hit while he was helping a friend get into a car .

" I was blindsided trying to help a fellow friend , " Campbell said .

Investigators in Statesville said there were nearly 200 teens at the party and four of them were shot after several fights broke out .
Vanessa Davidson lives across the street from the American Legion and saw the panic .

" We heard excessive gunfire , " Davidson said .
" Teenagers running that way , that way , up this way .
And then we heard this one young girl saying , ' My brother .
They shot my brother . '
And so we 're all traumatized .
"

She said it 's not the first time there 's been gunfire during an event at the American Legion .
She showed Eyewitness News a bullet hole in one of her windows .

" Nothing is going to be done until somebody gets killed , and that 's going be too late , " Davidson said .

Authorities said all of the victims will be OK.

" I 'm hurt , man .
Know what I mean ?
I just want to know what 's going on , " Campbell said .

Investigators canvassed the neighborhood Monday looking for information .
They believe the shooter left the scene in a red or burgundy Nissan .
