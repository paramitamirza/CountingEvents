" Even the doctors said there is a God , because if it was n't she would n't be here , "
April McKinney said .

McKinney 's daughter was getting ready for her senior prom when a 17-year - old boy pointed a gun at her and shot her in the chest .

" They said if it would have been a couple inches over , she would n't have made it , " McKinney said .

Quanisha Sims is in a hospital bed instead of enjoying the Booker T. Washington High School Prom .

Tavarius McKay , 17 , now faces an aggravated assault charge .
Witnesses said he was inside playing with the gun when it went off .

" It could have been one of my grandkids , because just before she got shot , she had just brought me her little small baby , " McKinney said .
"
[ She ] was telling me to hold her little baby , so she could wash the perm out of her head . "

McKinney said McKay is her other daughter 's boyfriend .
She said now she just has one question .

" Why did you shoot my child ?
Why would you even aim a gun towards her ? "
McKinney asked .
