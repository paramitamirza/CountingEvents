INDIANAPOLIS ( WISH ) —
An Indianapolis woman is pleading for the truth after witnesses told police her son died in an accidental shooting .
They said he shot himself while playing with a gun .

The Marion County Coroner ’s Office ruled the 15-year - old boy ’s death a homicide Thursday .
The coroner ’s office said he died from a gunshot wound to the head .

Kaiyana Rockingham told 24-Hour News 8 she saw her son in the hospital and believes there ’s more to what happened .
 “
The first thing I said was no not Dewaun he didn’t do this .
He didn’t do that , ” she said .
So it took for me to go to the hospital and see his face and see the wound in his head to know that he didn’t do it .
She said her son Dewaun Rockingham was the light of her life .

He was the light when he ’s around .
He lights up the room , ” she said .
“ He can bring laughter and love anywhere he goes . ”

Rockingham and other close family and friends spent Thursday night selling food in the parking lot of a church .

They’re trying to raise money to help pay for his funeral this weekend .

He was such a loving kid , he was such a loving kid , he was such a loving kid , ” she said .
He didn’t deserve this .
He did not deserve this . ”

The shooting happened inside of a home near Wallace and 33rd Street on June 22 .

Rockingham said her son spent the night at a friend ’s house when she received a phone call .

He was actually supposed to come home on Wednesday , ” she said .
I was supposed to pick him up after I got off from work .
I didn’t even make it to work before they were calling me and telling me that this incident had happened .
”
 Witnesses told police the shooting was accidental and that the 15-year - old shot himself while playing with a gun .

“ I deserve the truth Dewaun deserves the truth to be told , ” she said .
He didn’t deserve for somebody to say he did this to himself when you know that he didn’t .
Rockingham said her son had just graduated from middle school .
He loved to camp and had dreams of becoming a basketball player .
Rockingham said she can’t help but to feel a sense of regret .

It ’s just a lot of things that I wished I could have changed , ” she said .
I wish I could have change , maybe like
 saying no you can’t stay , no its time to come home .
A spokesperson for IMPD told 24-Hour News 8 in an email the shooting appears to be accidental .

Detectives are still waiting for a couple of things to be tested before presenting the case to the prosecutor ’s office .
