11-year - old charged in fatal shooting of north Nashville teen
NASHVILLE , Tenn. ( WKRN ) –
An 11-year - old boy has been charged with criminal homicide in the shooting death of a 15-year - old in north Nashville Friday afternoon .

Police said the shooting happened at 3:30 p.m. while the victim , DaVontae Ziegler , was sitting outside his Gwynnwood Drive home .
He was with the 11-year - old and another juvenile , all of whom were friends .

The 11-year - old told police he was playing with the gun , which he claims to have found , when DaVontae was shot .

DaVontae ran to a friend ’s home nearby on McCarthy Park Lane to ask for help .
He was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center where he died during surgery .

News 2 spoke with DaVontae ’s aunt and uncle , also his guardians .
They said they are devastated by the loss .

“ How come that parent didn’t know that child had a gun ?
My child is gone now .
I have to bury him and I can’t bury my child .
I just want him to come home , ” explained Amelia Griswould .

Her husband said the 11-year - old accused in the shooting came over to their home often .

“ He would come over and play video games .
He was over the other day , ” said Glenn Griswould .

The Griswoulds said DaVontae was a well - liked football player at Hunters Lane High School .
Hours before his death , he expressed excitement about getting his driver ’s license this year .

A funeral will be held for the teen next week .

The name of the 11-year - old will not be released since he is under the age of 14 .
He was released into the custody of his parents on Monday .

The youth was released to his family because authorities do not see him as a danger to the public .

A settlement hearing was originally scheduled for April 13 , but was continued until July 13 .

While Assistant District Attorney Stacy Miller did not want to address the case specifically , she talked about how juvenile defendants are treated differently than adults facing the same charges .

“
The big thing about juvenile court is that balancing of the public safety with the focus on [ the fact that ] these are kids .
If we want these kids to grow up and have a good life , we need to really focus on what went wrong and how can we fix it , and that ’s what we do , ” Miller explained , “ If we can allow a youth to leave detention and receive treatment , that ’s really what our goal is .
”

Miller said that it was possible for charges could be dropped if the 11-year - old adheres to the treatment and rehabilitation plan laid out for him in the hearing .
