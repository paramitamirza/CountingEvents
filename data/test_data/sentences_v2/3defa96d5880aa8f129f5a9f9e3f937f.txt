 COLUMBUS , Ohio ( WSYX/WTTE ) -- A two year old boy is fighting for his life after being shot in the head .

" So much happening around here man it is terrible , ” when Joe Baucum heard his two year old neighbor was shot this afternoon , his first reaction was shock , " I ca n't believe somebody doing that to a small kid . "

Columbus police say just before three o’clock Wednesday afternoon , the toddler , Jaeson Hill , was shot in the head by his father , 34-year - old Brandon Hill , inside their home on the 2700 block of Noe Bixby Road .

The father , who has been charged with child endangering , was the only other person at the home during the incident .

Police believe the weapon was n't secured at their home .

According to detectives , the father put the child in his vehicle and drove up the street where he flagged down a police officer explaining the child was shot accidentally .

" The father has been taken down to headquarters .
We 're trying to sort through exactly what happened , what took place and at that point we 'll see where this whole thing transpires and goes , ” said Columbus Police Sergeant Stan Latta .

The child was taken to Nationwide Children ’s Hospital with life threatening injuries .
While police wait to see if the two year olds condition changes , neighbors like Baucum , who 's a gun owner , does n't buy this was an accident .

" I look at this way , if you have your gun right , there ai n't going to be no accidents . "

Authorities say they’ll be watching the boys condition as their investigation continues .
