In Shooting In West Garfield Park
CHICAGO ( CBS ) —
A 10-year - old boy was shot in front of his family Monday night , while on his porch in the West Garfield Park neighborhood .

Even though Tavon Tanner made it out of surgery overnight , he was still listed in critical condition Tuesday morning at Mount Sinai Hospital .
 “
He got hit in the kidney ; they patched it up .
He got hit in the pancreas ; they took a piece off .
He got hit in the intestines ; they took a piece off .
He got hit in the spleen ; they removed it .
And bullet is lodged in his chest , ” said his mother , Mellanie Washington .

Tavon was on his porch in the 3900 block of West Polk Street with his mother , aunt , and 7-year - old brother when shots were fired around 10:15 p.m. Monday .
A bullet struck Tavon in the back .

“ He fell down , he fell backwards on the floor , and he started beating the floor , saying , I’m burning , I’m burning , ” his mother said .

His twin sister , Taniyah , who was inside the home at the time , ran out on the porch to be with her brother .

“
She was down there with him , holding him , saying ‘
Twin , don’t leave me .
Please don’t leave me.’
My heart is real heavy right now , ”
Washington said .

Taniyah said she felt her brother ’s pain , even though she wasn’t physically hurt .
The two are best friends , and have been looking forward to starting the 5th grade in the fall .
Tears rolled down her eyes as she talked about doing what she could to help him after he was shot .

“ I told him to keep his eyes open , and he kept it open .
He kept his eyes open , because I told him to keep it open , and if he closed it , I opened it back up , ” she said .

Tavon ’s family is praying for a full recovery .
Washington said doctors have told them the road to recovery will be a long one .

She also pleaded with the shooter to turn himself or herself in .

“
I nor my child did anything to anyone .
My baby is innocent .
He ’s only a baby .
I’m just sitting on my own porch , and my child gets shot like that , ” she said .

Area Central detectives were investigating .
