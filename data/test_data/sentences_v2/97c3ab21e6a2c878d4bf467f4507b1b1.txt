Bisher says he called 911 .

" I was worried about keeping the blood from going in his lungs , so I tried to keep him up right , " says Bisher .
" He was conscious the whole time .
He was talking
, I 'd ask him to spit and he would spit blood out . "

Bisher says he continued to put pressure on the wound near the bridge of his nose before the ambulance showed up .
