DAVIE , Fla. ( WSVN ) -- A 3-year - old boy shot his mother in Davie , early Monday morning .

According to police , at around 3 a.m. , in the area of Southwest 48th Avenue and 59th Terrace , the boy gained access to the mother 's weapon and shot her in the leg as she was sleeping .

" A 3-year - old male had gained access to his parent 's weapon , " said Davie Police Capt .
Dale Engle .
" He discharged one round striking the mother in the leg . "

She was transported to Memorial Regional Hospital with injuries that were not life - threatening .
She underwent surgery and is expected to be OK.

Detectives are investigating the factors involved , including why the young boy was awake at such a late hour and how he got access to the weapon .
The Department of Children and Families is interviewing the child as part of their investigation .

Neighbors were in disbelief when police arrived on the scene .
" Shocked , " said neighbor Duane Schultz .
" I could n't figure out what was going on . "

The parents said the handgun was not where they normally leave it . "
The child was able to gain access to it , " said Engle .
" It 's just a blessing that no one died in this case . "

Charges have not been issued , but police said they are forthcoming .
" There is a statute that requires any gun owner to store the weapon properly so that children ca n't gain access to it .
It 's definitely something that we 're looking at , and I do anticipate at some point that charges may be brought forward towards the parents , " said Engle .

Neighbors said they heard no noise at the time of the incident and claimed that multiple children live in the home .
" I heard nothing , nothing at all , " said one neighbor .
" I was sound asleep . "

The children are currently under the supervision of their grandparents .

Engle said those who own guns have to be responsible , especially near young children .
" You really have to be aware that you have something in your possession that your children may gain access to that is deadly , " he said .
" It 's not a light thing .
You have to take this seriously . "
