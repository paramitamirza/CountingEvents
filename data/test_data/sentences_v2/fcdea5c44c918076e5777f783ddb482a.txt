 Jackson — Elaine and Brian Spitler were returning home from Meijer in December 2014 when Elaine spotted the flashing lights of police and fire vehicles in their neighborhood .

Turning down their cul - de - sac , they realized the vehicles were in front of their home .
Brian fretted one of their sons had caused a fire while cooking .

It was worse than that .

Riley Spitler , then 16 , thought a gun was empty when he jokingly pointed it at his 20-year - old brother and pulled the trigger , he later told police .

The bullet struck Patrick in the heart , killing him .

Riley was later convicted of second - degree murder and , three months ago , was sentenced to up to 46 years in prison .

It ’s such a tragedy , ” said Kevin Pearson , a friend of Pat ’s .
The family didn’t just lose Pat .
They lost Riley , too .
The parents’ anguish didn’t stop there .

The weapon that killed one son and sent the other to prison was bought by their mother , said Blackman - Leoni Township police .

Riley had convinced his mom he needed the .380-caliber Taurus semiautomatic for self - defense .

She never told her husband , who didn’t allow guns in the home , police said .

So today , in a quiet , emptier home on a dead - end street , a grieving man feels betrayed and a grieving woman bears guilt for their sadness .

I could just strangle her .
She didn’t tell me anything , ”
Brian told an officer about his wife , according to video from the officer ’s body camera .

The Spitlers , who declined comment , are preparing to appeal the verdict to the Michigan Court of Appeals .
Their attorney , Al Brandt , also declined comment .

During the sentencing , Brian Spitler lambasted prosecutors for pushing for such a long prison term .

Jackson County Assistant Prosecutor Steve Idema objected to the criticism , telling the judge Spitler wasn’t speaking on behalf of Patrick , according to a transcript of the hearing .

I am speaking on behalf of Patrick , ” Spitler spat at Idema .
“ I’m the only one in this room who represents Patrick . ”

Idema declined comment for this story .

The story of how a single , horrific incident cost the Spitlers both of their children comes from interviews , trial transcripts , court files and police records .
The records contained videotaped interviews of witnesses , including a 90-minute interrogation where Riley seemed to speak candidly about the incident and his life .

The two brothers couldn’t be more different , Riley told police during the interview six days after the Dec. 6 shooting .

Riley was a quiet , sullen loner , he and others told police .
Despite being smart and articulate , he dropped out of school in the ninth grade .

Riley told police he doesn’t like being told what to do .
 “
I’m not the most talkative or social person ever , ” he said .
“ I don’t really take help from anybody .
I don’t really listen to anybody .
Riley , who worked at McDonald ’s , said he sometimes sold drugs for a friend .

Pat , on the other hand , was a popular chatterbox with a goofy sense of humor , said his friends .

He also was a workhorse , putting in 18-hour days at Gordon Food Service and the Jackson YMCA.

At the YMCA , where he was a coach , bus driver and summer camp counselor , he was a favorite of the kids , chief executive Rick Wilson said .

Children were drawn to his constant smile and upbeat personality , Wilson said .
He made them laugh by dressing up as Batman and Scooby - Doo .

Each and every day was a joy when Pat was in our building , ” he said .

Pat tried to encourage his brother to do better , said friends .
He felt Riley was smart and articulate but was wasting his life .

Pat had to tread carefully to avoid arguments with the volatile Riley , said friends .

Three months before the 2014 shooting , the brothers fought after Pat criticized Riley , Riley told police .

They pushed each other , Riley struck Pat and Pat wrestled him to the ground .

“ We would just fight all the time , ” said Riley .
“ We straight up didn’t like each other .
”

 Behavior unknown to dad
 On Nov. 26 , 10 days before the shooting , Riley and his mother visited a Dunham ’s Sports store in Jackson .

She paid $ 225 for the Taurus handgun in cash , according to the receipt , contained in the police file .

Riley told police his mom was aware he was selling drugs .
He said that was the reason he gave her for needing the gun .

That wasn’t the only thing Elaine Spitler knew about her wayward son .

In his bedroom was another semiautomatic handgun , two revolvers and a duffel bag holding four one - gallon Ziploc bags containing marijuana marked Chronic Thunder , Critical Rush , Liberty Haze and Blueberry .

Riley told his mom he was holding the drugs and weapons for a longtime friend who had recently been charged with carrying a concealed weapon , he told police .

Asked by police why his mom allowed such behavior , he said he often got his way by threatening to run away .

I know what you think about my mom , ” Riley told police .
“ You know , horrible mother , horrible mother of the year .
He said his father didn’t know any of this .
Brian Spitler was never home , working two jobs as a bank security guard and at a phone parts warehouse .

Brian Spitler told police he learned about the drugs and guns right after the shooting when his wife told him about them , according to video from an officer ’s body camera .

Gun worried older brother
 Shortly after receiving the Taurus , Riley was walking into the house one day when he flashed it to his brother .

Pat , who was eating at the kitchen table , stopped chewing and asked whether it was real , Riley told police .

“ His eyes lit up , ” said Riley .

Privately , Pat was concerned , he confided in several friends .

A week after seeing the gun , Pat was taking a weekly run with Dalton Dueck and asked if his friend could keep a secret , Dueck later told police .

Pat , who didn’t know about the other weapons in his home , told Dueck about the gun , saying he was worried Riley might hurt someone .
Dueck asked Pat if he was afraid Riley might hurt him .

He was , like , right off the bat , ‘
No , not at all.’ He was real adamant , ”
Dueck told investigators , according to police video of the interview .

Pat told Dueck he had talked to his mom about the gun but she didn’t want to confront Riley .
He apparently didn’t know his mom had bought the weapon .

Pat said if he couldn’t resolve the matter in a few days , he would tell his father about it , Dueck told police .

Two days later , Pat was dead .

‘
You shot me’

On the night of Dec. 6 , Pat was sitting on his bed , texting a friend , when Riley came into his room with the Taurus .

Waiting for his brother to finish , Riley loaded and unloaded the gun , he told police .

Pat ’s trophies from high school and youth soccer were on the dresser , according to video from an officer ’s body camera .
A blow - up Spiderman stood in the corner .

Riley showed Pat how quickly he could rack the slide , and then handed the unloaded gun to his brother to see how fast he could do it , he told police .

Riley reloaded the gun , racked the slide , which ejected a bullet , and pointed the weapon at his brother .

Let ’s see if it ’s your lucky day , ” he said .

He pulled the trigger .

You shot me , ” screamed Pat .

Riley , who had had the weapon for just 10 days , later told police he thought he had released the magazine before ejecting the bullet .

In fact , the six - bullet magazine was still connected to the gun , feeding another round into the chamber when the first one was ejected .

Riley called 911 while holding a rag to his brother ’s heart .
 “
Breathe , please breathe , ” said Riley , according to a recording of the call .
I love you , Pat .
I love you . ”

Riley rushed outside to greet the police but his front glass door was locked or jammed
so he used his fists to break through it , he said .

Barefoot and shirtless in the December cold , he didn’t realize his right hand was bleeding .

“ I don’t care if I spend the rest of my life in jail , ” he told an officer .
I just need to know that he ’s alive .
Police skeptical of account
 Police and prosecutors didn’t believe Riley ’s story .

They doubted that Pat , after expressing fears about the gun , would play with it .

They said a more likely scenario , given the brothers’ turbulent relationship , was that Riley got angry for some reason and shot Pat .

“ I think your brother was giving you some crap about the guns and you tried to intimidate him and the next thing that happened : you shot him , ” Detective Chris Boulter told Riley during the 2014 interview .

Boulter declined comment .

During a five - day trial in Jackson County Circuit Court , prosecutors made hay of Riley ’s troubled past , talking about how he sold drugs and hid guns for his friend .

The jury could have convicted Riley of involuntary manslaughter , punishable by up to 15 years in prison .

Instead , after deliberating two days , it found him guilty of second - degree murder , punishable by up to life .

Involuntary manslaughter involves careless behavior while second - degree murder involves an action that shows utter disregard for life .

Another name for the latter is depraved heart murder .

Riley , who also was convicted of possession with intent to deliver marijuana and two counts of possessing a firearm during a felony , was given a prison sentence of 24 - 46 years .

He’ll be eligible for parole in 20 years .

On the night of the shooting , sitting in an ambulance getting his hand treated , Riley repeatedly asked police and paramedics how his brother was doing , according to police videos .

Fearing how he would respond , they lied and said they didn’t know .

“ Please tell me he ’s still alive , ” said Riley .
If not , just shoot me dead ’cause I
can’t do this .
This is my brother ’s blood on my hands .
