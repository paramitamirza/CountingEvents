No family members appeared in court .

Witnesses told police a large group of family friends were talking in front of a home at 425 NW 13th Street when Hollinger brought out a gun .

They was playing with the gun and just trying to see like the parts of it and he was trying to take the bullets out but he left one in .
He pointed it at him and he shot it .
Nothing happened .
Shot it again , nothing happened .
The third time the boy got shot in the chest , ” said Ashley Kendall .
“ I’m very sad .
I watched him die .
It hurt my heart .
After the shooting , Hollinger ran off and hid the gun in some nearby bushes .

Friends said he loved to laugh and play football .

I’m expecting him to come home , but he will never come home again .
A vigil in Darin ’s memory is planned for Thursday at 7 pm at the scene of the shooting .
