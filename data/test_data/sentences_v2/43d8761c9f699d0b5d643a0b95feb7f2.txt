A Richmond man is facing charges after a 5-year - old used his gun to shoot another 5-year - old , according to Chesterfield Police .

Investigators say a child found the gun at the Winchester Greens Apartments and shot his friend .
Officers are faulting William Griffin , 28 , for the crime .
Neighbors say he 's the boyfriend of the victim 's mother and say he even cares for the child like he 's his own .
Police say he owned the gun and is being charged with felony child abuse and neglect."There was a scream and then my neighbor was knocking on my door saying , ‘ help me , my baby ' , ” said a nurse who lives next door to where it all unfolded .
She does n't want to be identified but rushed to the little boy 's aid .

" If you have an entrance wound , you 've got to have an exit , so I rolled him over to see , " she said .
" I basically sandwiched him in my hands , elevated his feet , loosened his clothing , so he would n't go into shock , ”

Ten minutes later , emergency medical crews arrived to rush the child to the hospital .
Chesterfield police say Griffin left his gun unsecured , providing easy access for three children who were playing upstairs while the adults were downstairs .

“
Children are attracted to and can operate firearms that can cause severe injury or death .
They tell you that in the manual , ” read Neil Bailey from a gun manufacturer 's manual .
He sells guns at Bob Moates Sport Shop in Chesterfield and informs every customer of the importance of gun locks , which he also sells .

" Most of them will come with two sets of keys and then there are firearms that have locks built into them , ” Bailey explained .

He also recommends lock boxes for easy access .

" It 's really sad that the family is broken right now .
The mother is at the hospital with the son , ” the neighbor said .

She is relieved to learn the little boy is expected to pull through .

" They 're very good people and this was an accident .
Accidents happen , ” the neighbor added .
