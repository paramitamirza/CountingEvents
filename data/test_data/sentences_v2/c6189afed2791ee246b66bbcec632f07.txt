A H - E - B employee who allegedly shot and killed one fellow worker and injured three others Monday morning at a South Texas store believed “ everybody was out to get him , ”
Palmview Police Chief Christopher Barrera said in an interview with mySA.com .

“
He was paranoid .
He felt everybody was out to get him , " Barrera said , adding that the suspect did n't target a specific individual .

Raul Lopez , 25 , faces one first - degree felony charge of murder and three second - degree felony counts of attempted murder , Barrera said .

At around 3:15 a.m. , Lopez allegedly fired 15 shots at a break room window of the H - E - B store at 1840 W. Palma Vista Drive in Palmview , about 10 miles west of McAllen , Barrera said , hitting four employees .

 Mario Pulido , 48 , was pronounced dead at the scene .
Bill Martinez , 33 , and Rafael Martinez , 37 , were transported to a nearby hospital in critical condition , Barrera said .
Frailian Garza , 51 , sustained non - life - threatening injuries .

Lopez fled the scene but later called the Hidalgo County Sheriff ’s Office to turn himself in , Barrera said .
He drew investigators a map to find the 9 mm handgun he used in the shooting , which he had tossed in a field near his residence in Western Hidalgo County , Barrera said .

Barrera said the 25-year - old employee , who does not have a prior criminal record , did not target specific employees .
Lopez intended to scare the victims , not injure them , Barrera said .

" Anybody could 've been in the break room , " he said .
