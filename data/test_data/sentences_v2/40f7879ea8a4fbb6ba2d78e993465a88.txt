Montrose County fined for pregnancy discrimination
MONTROSE , Colo. ( AP ) —
A jury has found Montrose County guilty of discriminating against a pregnant woman .

The former employee was fired after seeking to work part - time during her pregnancy .

The ( Grand Junction ) Daily Sentinel reports ( http://bit.ly/1VFOy9A ) that Stephanie Barnett won an award of $ 306,400 mostly in backpay damages .

Barnett was the former director of the county ’s internal services division .
She was fired in 2013 after talking with a manager about a transition to working part - time during her pregnancy .

Nine days after the meeting , Barnett was fired .

Hours after she was fired , Barnett started to experience abdominal pain and she miscarried her baby less than week later .

The county said that the pregnancy was not why Barnett was fired , though jurors disagreed .
