One man was killed , three others injured , when they were shot in a robbery attempt in Pompano Beach over night .

The four men were playing dominoes outside a Pompano Beach home in the 1600 block of NW 7th Lane around 1 a.m. Sunday when four armed individuals tried to rob them , according to the Broward Sheriff ’s Office .

“ The gun was at my head .
And it missed my head and hit me in each arm and in one leg .
And I’m still able to walk .
I’m still breathing , ” said one of the men who was shot but did not wish to be identified in this report .

He said they were all sitting around playing when they heard footsteps .
Suddenly four men stood over them and demand their money .

There was nothing to give in the first place .
But they just said ‘ give it up’.
So we just sat there we were looking at each other ,
is it a joke ?
And they started shooting at us , ” said the man .

“ We were watching a YouTube video and we heard a few gunshots go off and we immediately just froze for a minute , like what is going on ?
We thought it was some fireworks , ” said neighbor Samuel Jennings .
“ Everybody was panicking .
One dude was shot in the side .
He ran inside the house .
”

Joshua Childs , 23 , was pronounced dead on the scene .
Alphonso Wright , 54 , and Christopher Singleton , 35 , were taken by fire rescue to Broward Health North .

Rashaad Payne , 23 , who immediately ran when the gunfire erupted was driven by a relative to the same hospital .
All are expected to survive .

It was crazy because I actually opened up the door and seen one of the dudes lying on the ground .
I walked over and looked at the garage and saw another dude lying on the ground .
I was like ‘
Wow , I can’t believe that this really happened’ , ” said Jennings .

Broward Sheriff ’s Office spokesman Mike Jachles said the individuals they are looking for should be considered extremely dangerous .

This was nothing short of a brazen attempt of four people who have no regard for human life .
They were playing dominoes , ” said Jachles .
“ They were not bothering anybody .
They attempted to rob them .
”

Jennings said the shooting really shook him up .
He was playing dominoes on Saturday in the spot where the shooting happened .
He said it could very well have been him in the hospital – or worse .

I normally have my boys out here and we outside and everything too .
So I’m just happy none of my boys was around when this happen because it could have been bigger than it actually turned out to be , ” said Jennings .

Unfortunately none of the three injured men were able to provide a good description of their attackers .

They had skullies on their head and bandanas around their face .
I only know that they were all black males and they wore dark clothes .
One of them had a big assault rifle and the rest of them had handguns , ” said the man .

The sheriff ’s office hopes someone steps forward and helps them solve this case before it happens again .

They are armed .
They are dangerous .
We need to get them off the streets .
They’ve killed , injured .
They can do it again , ” said Jachles .

Anyone with information about the case should call Broward Crime Stoppers at ( 954 ) 493-TIPS ( 8477 ) .
