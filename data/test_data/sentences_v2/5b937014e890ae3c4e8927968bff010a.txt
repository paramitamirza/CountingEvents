DETROIT -
 Detroit Police Chief James Craig said Friday morning two people are in custody in connection to a shooting which killed a 3-year - old girl and injured three of her family members Thursday afternoon on the city 's east side .

Amiracle Williams was killed when gunfire broke out in front of her family 's home on Mogul Street .
Four other people were injured in the shooting , including Amiracle 's 47-year - old father , Demetrius Williams , and 40-year - old mother , Frieda Tiggs .
Tkira Steen , Amiracle 's 17-year - old sister , also was hit with the gunfire .
The fourth person injured is one of the men in custody .

Steen is 6-months pregnant , Local 4 has learned .
She is in fair condition at St. John Hospital , where Demetrius Williams also is in fair condition and Tiggs is in good condition .
Amiracle died at the hospital on Thursday .
She was transported by police officers .

" The two officers who transported Amiracle to the hospital are struggling , " said Craig .

Craig said this started as a fight between two young females on Facebook .
It became physical in front of the home on Mogul Street .
Demetrius Williams saw the fight and tried to stop it .
He was armed with a gun .
The fight was between his teenage daughter and another teen .
He allegedly was defending his daughter .

It 's unclear who fired the first shot , but Craig said a 23-year - old man who showed up at the home opened fire on Amiracle and her parents with a TEC-9 semi - automatic handgun .
This apparently was in direct retaliation to Amiracle 's father shooting a 22-year - old man who was involved in the fight .

Update : Shooter arrested in killing of # Detroit girl , 3 .
Getaway driver also arrested .
Retaliation for girl 's father shooting man in fight .

Contrary to reports on Thursday , Craig said this did not start as a fight at Denby High School , but instead started on the social media site and spilled over to outside in front of the home .

The chief said the shooter and his getaway driver , the 22-year - old man who was shot , both are in custody .
He said the shooter was wanted on an out - of - state warrant .

" The suspect who we have in custody , the shooter , removed the machine gun and began to fire repeatedly , striking , as I pointed out , five victims including the fatal shooting of the 3-year - old , " said Craig .

He said known gang members were involved in this shooting , but said that does n't mean this was " gang - related . "

" It 's not gang - related , but gang - involved .
Gang - related means two different gangs were involved in a conflict .
That 's not the case here , " the chief said .
" It 's very upsetting .
This was a decision made by a coward . "
