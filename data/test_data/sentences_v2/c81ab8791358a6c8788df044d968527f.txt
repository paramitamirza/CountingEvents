Suspected J’Ouvert killer was intoxicated at time of shooting
The accused killer of a gifted St. John ’s University grad student raged on with his night of J’Ouvert mayhem after drunkenly blasting her in the face , cops said Tuesday .

Suspect Reginald Moise , 20 , was so wasted and high when firing the fatal shot near the end of the annual celebration that he didn’t know the dying woman was even wounded , cops said .

Moise then barely missed killing a 1-year - old boy sleeping in his crib when he shot up a relative ’s Brooklyn apartment while hiding the murder weapon , said cops and the child ’s mother .
The bullet went through the relative ’s wall and into a neighbor ’s apartment .

Ballistics evidence from the two scenes implicated Moise , who was first arrested for drunken driving around 8 a.m. Monday while behind the wheel of a 2002 Ford Explorer with a missing wheel and a broken axle , cops said .

 Moise fired his 9-mm .
Glock around four hours earlier at the tail end of the annual celebration , striking Tiarah Poyau above her right eye from close range on a Crown Heights street , police said .

I think I shot somebody on the parade route , ” cops quoted Moise as telling a friend after squeezing off the shot that ended Poyau ’s promising young life .
I didn’t know the gun was loaded . ”

The globe - trotting 22-year - old victim , who had just finished a summer internship at PricewaterhouseCoopers , died a short time later at Kings County Hospital .

But cops said Moise ’s wild night of random gunfire wasn’t done yet .

The boozed - up Brooklyn man called his cousin , looking to ditch the murder weapon in her Montgomery St. apartment , police sources said .

It ’s too hot , ” he reportedly said of the 9-mm .
handgun .

Neighbor Nadia Bryan was awake to check on her baby in their fourth - floor apartment when she heard two gunshots coming from next door .

One bullet then tore through the wall of her apartment , directly above her child ’s crib .

Four shot , two fatally , in J’Ouvert parade violence
 “
It was by the grace of God that I wasn’t hurt or my son wasn’t hurt , ” said Bryan , 30 .

Moise was charged with second - degree murder , criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment .
He had five previous sealed arrests on his rap sheet , police sources said .

Walberto Perez , 23 , a high school friend of the dead woman , said the fatal shooting was senseless .

She was a really great girl , ” said Perez .
She didn’t deserve this . ”

NYPD safety upgrades fail to prevent J’Ouvert shooting
 The casings found in the apartment on Montgomery St. resembled those found on the street at the murder scene , and were later matched at the NYPD crime lab .

The aluminum jacket we recovered at that scene was the same as the crime scene on Empire Blvd .
, ” confirmed NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce .

The gunman left his pistol behind at the apartment before bolting .
And he couldn’t keep his mouth shut .
 “
He makes statements to two people that implicate himself , and he makes statements to my detectives as well that he did not know the gun was loaded , ” the chief added .

Moise also smashed a mirror with his hand while in the apartment , and had a flag from a Caribbean nation wrapped around his bleeding hand when arrested .

Cops said the suspect slammed the Explorer into several parked cars , and was slurring his speech and struggling to stay upright when arrested .

A woman in the apartment where Moise had dumped the weapon called police around 11 a.m. , and the pieces soon fell into place .
Moise was in custody for about three hours before investigators realized their DWI suspect was also a possible murderer .

He ’s a good boy .
This surprised our whole family , ” a woman claiming to be a relative of the suspected shooter said as she waited outside the 70th Precinct Tuesday .
“ We believe this is a case of mistaken identity or maybe one of his friends did it and he took the blame .

This will get resolved , and I truly , truly know it was not him , ” she added .

A neighbor of the Poyau family hailed the police for the arrest , and wondered what was going through the suspect ’s mind .

“ Why would you bring a gun to a parade ?
” asked Anna Jackson , 57 .
“ You’re supposed to have fun , not shoot people .
”
 Cops remained stumped Tuesday in the second J’Ouvert murder , the shooting of a 17-year - old boy who walked over to a bench and sat down — unaware that he was shot near the intersection of Flatbush Ave . and Empire Blvd .
Tyreke Borel died at 5:11 a.m. at Kings County Hospital .
