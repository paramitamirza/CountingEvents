4-Year - Old Critically Wounds 3-Year - Old In Accidental Shooting
A 3-year - old girl was accidentally shot by her 4-year - old brother at a home on Glenwood Avenue Tuesday .

Police say the gun was loaded , ready and sitting out within reach of the children .

" It 's horrible , I could n't imagine going through it , ” neighbor Amber Litton said .

Litton woke to flashing lights and emergency vehicles outside her house .
They were there to help the 3-year - old girl next door .

" My kids play with them all the time , " Litton said .

That 's why it was shocking for Litton to learn a gun had been left out and picked up by the little girl 's 4-year - old brother .

" It 's our understanding it was recovered from a common area of the house and was loaded ready at hand , " Columbus Police Detective Jay Fulton said .

Police say the mother , her boyfriend and three kids were staying with the homeowner .
The boyfriend was at work .
His gun was left out at the home .
The little boy got ahold of it and it discharged at close range to his sister .

During the 911 call , the caller can be heard explaining a child was playing with the gun and another child got shot in the back of the neck but the child was breathing and conscious .

Police believe the family had the gun ready , fearing for their safety after recent problems .
Litton said she ’s nervous because she had no idea her children had been around it .

" Yes , because she 's been over there quite a few times especially in the past three years , " Litton said .

Police think the family narrowly escaped a real tragedy .
They hope it 's a lesson for all .

"
Just hope that this can serve as a reminder to keep these firearms secured , " Det .
Fulton said .

Once the investigation is complete , detectives will talk with the prosecutor 's office about possible charges .
