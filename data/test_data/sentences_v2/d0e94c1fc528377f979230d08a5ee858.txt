It happened in the 3400 block of Stonewall Lane .

Police said they were called to home for a shooting call .

Police say he got into an argument with someone before he was shot .

Friends say Jones was turning his life around .
He moved to Fort Worth a few years ago to go to school and play basketball .

" I want him to be remembered as a good man , " said friend Robert Thornton .

The pair became best friends .

Thornton said he and Jones were together at a friend 's birthday party a few hours before the shooting .

It 's my time to stand tall and be there for him , and keep going with my life . "
