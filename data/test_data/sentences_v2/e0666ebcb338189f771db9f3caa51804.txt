( Recasts , adds quotes , detail , Citi court filing )

 LONDON , Sept 8 ( Reuters ) -
A former Citigroup foreign
 exchange trader claiming unfair dismissal after a currency
 rigging scandal told a London court on Tuesday that the
 activities for which he was fired were common practice at the
 U.S. bank at that time .

Perry Stimpson , dismissed from Citigroup 's London desk last
 November in the wake of a scandal that resulted in banks paying
 billions of dollars in fines , told the East London employment
 tribunal that he wanted to set the record straight and repair
 his reputation .

In a filing to the court , Citi said that Stimpson was
 dismissed for serious breach of contract , alleging that he
 appeared to have shared confidential client information with
 traders at other banks via electronic chatrooms .

Citi said Stimpson also took " steps to deliberately conceal
 such disclosures " .

Stimpson , who is representing himself , said : " I 'm not here
 to mud - sling , I 'm here to ensure the truth about foreign
 exchange at Citigroup is heard once and for all . "

Industry sources have said the case could be the first of
 many claims by traders fired over allegations of misconduct in
 the $ 5.3 trillion - a - day foreign exchange market .

" I 'm trying to paint a picture of the bank at the time and
 why my actions were normal across the industry and at the
 respondent ( Citi ) ...
It shows the information - sharing practices
 that I have been criticised for was a common practice , " Stimpson
 told the packed hearing at the start of a case scheduled to last
 four days .

Employment tribunal judge Alison Russell ruled that there
 would be no reporting restrictions on the naming of Citigroup
 staff mentioned during proceedings .
She also ruled that
 Stimpson 's case would not be rolled together with those of three
 other former Citigroup forex traders scheduled to be heard in
 the coming weeks .

A lawyer for Citigroup , Diya Sen Gupta , had told the hearing
 that it would be " contrary to the interests of justice " if other
 Citi staff were named without having had a chance to respond to
 allegations .

Stimpson said at the hearing that it would be unfair to
 allow senior Citi staff to remain anonymous .

" My dismissal has been a very public affair , " he said .

" Senior management -- responsible for a lack of controls -- have
 been afforded complete anonymity .
I would see that as unfair . "
