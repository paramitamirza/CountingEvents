Watch this story
 The class was in session at KayJay Gun Shop in Monroe Township .

Yellow crime tape still blocked off part of the area Saturday night .

Family members were emotional , crying and hugging each other close at the gun shop after the shooting .

" I seen like 15 sheriff 's cars come , two ambulances , and I was waiting on the helicopter to come pick him up you know , but it did n't .
And they put yellow tape around and I knew he was dead , " neighbor Anita Fritz said .

Clermont County sheriff 's deputies said the shop â€™s owner , James Baker , 64 , was killed by a weapon he showed others how to use safely .

Investigators said Baker was shot in the neck while sitting in a nearby room as someone taking a CCW class practiced weapon malfunction drills .

Attempts were made to revive Baker , but he was pronounced dead at 3:12 p.m. at the shop .

Fritz said she is heartbroken .

" An accident like that , it 's not , it 's bad , just terrible for the family , so I feel very bad for them , " she said .

People who knew him called him Jim , a neighbor who went the extra mile to lend a hand and keep people safe .
 " Sheriff 's and the cops come in and out all the time cause they loved him , you know , everybody did .
All the neighbors did .
So it 's a tragic thing that happened , " Fritz said .

Baker 's gun shop offers a long list of training courses to teach people to use guns like rifles and pistols the correct way .

Now , many in this tight - knit community say they are devastated knowing he wo n't be here to do that anymore .

" He 's just a great guy , I mean , I ca n't believe it happened , it 's hard to believe , just a really good guy , " Fritz said .
" I 'm going to miss him because he was a good neighbor . "

We also talked with a man who lives just a few houses down from where it happened .

He told us Baker gave him his very first job , calling him a great boss and friend .

Investigators are n't saying what type of gun was used or if any charges will be filed .
