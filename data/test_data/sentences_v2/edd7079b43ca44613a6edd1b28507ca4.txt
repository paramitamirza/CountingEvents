A 19-year - old Northeast Philadelphia man was charged with the shooting death of a 14-year - old boy in Mayfair , police said .

Samir Price , of the 6100 block of Loretto Avenue in Oxford Circle , surrendered to police Tuesday afternoon in the Nov. 28 killing of Ian Wilsey .
On Wednesday , he was charged with murder , robbery and related offenses .

Price was arrested last year for robbery and aggravated assault .
The case was listed for trial three times and then withdrawn by the prosecution in September .

No one answered the door Wednesday night at the house on Loretto Avenue listed in public records as Price 's residence .

Wilsey , a ninth - grader at Northeast High School , was shot to death when he and another teenager were ambushed on the 6200 block of Brous Avenue , police said .

In the days after the shooting , which shocked the teenager 's friends , police said the motive for the slaying was n't known .
Wilsey 's friend initially told investigators that the two had been walking to a nearby store to get a snack , but a source later said the pair may have been ambushed after two men saw them selling marijuana to another friend .

Authorities on Wednesday did n't immediately provide additional details about any potential motive .

Wilsey was shot once in the chest and taken to Aria Health - Torresdale Campus , where he was pronounced dead at 9:37 p.m. that night .
The other teen was n't harmed .

Friends have described Wilsey as athletic and outgoing , and said he enjoyed playing football , basketball and video games .
