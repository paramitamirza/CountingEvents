Man ordered to stay away from teen prior to North Shore shooting - Hawaii News Now - KGMB and KHNL
New details about the relationship between a 17-year - old girl and a 44-year - old man who took their lives in a North Shore parking lot over the weekend are prompting domestic violence advocates to question whether authorities could have done more to protect the teen .

The Honolulu Medical Examiner 's office has confirmed that both committed suicide with a firearm .

While Hawaii News Now does n't typically report on suicides , this case raises serious questions about the justice system and whether law enforcement could have intervened earlier when red flags were raised .

The 44-year - old man who the teen was in a relationship with has been identified as Shane Francisco , her one - time mentor .
Hawaii News Now is not identifying the teen .

Last October , the girl 's mother filed a restraining order against Francisco , court documents show .
Her mother told the court that her daughter 's relationship with Francisco may have started three years earlier , when the girl was 13 or 14 .

When an officer asked if the teen wanted to press charges , the mother said her daughter became confused and disturbed -- and then ran away .

Nanci Kreidman , of the Domestic Violence Action Center , said the response was n't surprising .

" It 's very scary to become involved with the criminal justice system that does n't always work and more retaliation is possible , " she said .

But Kreidman is asking why police did n't charge Francisco for having sex with a minor .

And despite the TRO , Hawaii News Now has learned , Francisco was still allowed to carry a gun for his military duties as a master sergeant with the Army National Guard .

At the same time last year , Francisco 's ex - wife was also granted a restraining order .
She said she felt threatened after he loaded his gun in their home .

If only , Kreidman says , police had intervened at that point .

" Possibly this young woman would be alive today , " she said .
" Possibly , he could have gotten the help he needed and his family would n't be destroyed , his children would still have their father . "

Kawika Rogers , the girl 's recent boyfriend , says she appeared to be an abusive relationship with Francisco .
Rogers says the girl said she was engaged to Francisco , but Rogers sensed she wanted to escape .

" She kept telling me she wanted to come to Washington , " Rogers said .
" She wanted to get off the island and come stay with me . "

Rogers , a Marine stationed on the Mainland , says Francisco called him in July -- with the teen at his side -- and forced her to choose between him or Rogers .

" I could hear her just crying in the background , " Rogers said .

Rogers says the 17-year - old was afraid of Francisco and wanted out of their relationship , but Rogers had no idea she was in serious danger .

" There were a lot of issues with him and her and he was just trying to work his way into her life , " said Rogers .
" She was trying to get away from the guy because I know he was causing problems . "
