Watch the report
 The Attorney General 's Office said Nina Obukhov , 34 ; Katherine Obukhov , 8 ; and Elizabeth Obukhov , 6 , were all shot in the head at 17 McAfee Farm Road .

Police spent the past two days at the home on McAfee Farm Road gathering evidence as the community waited to hear how the three people inside died .

" The manner of death of the children has been determined to be a homicide , " Assistant Attorney General Jay McCormack said .

The Attorney General 's Office said police got a 911 call Saturday morning from Nina Obukhov 's husband , Alexey Obukhov .

" I ca n't make any statements regarding his whereabouts or where he is , " McCormack said .

When police arrived at the home , they found the bodies of the two girls and Nina Obukhov .

" That 's one of the focuses of our investigation going forward , is to help determine why this might have happened , " McCormack said .

On Monday , a disaster response crew went through the house and cleaned .

" I do n't know how to process it either , " Bedford school superintendent Chip McGee said .
" It 's incredibly sad and something that does n't make sense . "

McGee said Elizabeth Obukhov went to a private kindergarten , but Katherine Obukhov was in third grade at Riddle Brook Elementary School .
He said grief counselors will be at the school all week while teachers try to keep a normal routine .

" So that on top of their having to process this loss , they do n't also have to figure out why they did n't get to go to gym today or missed art class , " he said .

McGee said it 's important for parents to listen to their children .

" You do n't know what they 're thinking and to give your kids a chance to talk , " he said .
" Another is to recognize that they 're going to hear things and know things . "

Investigators would n't say exactly when the shootings happened .

They said they 're waiting to hear more from the medical examiner before releasing more information .
