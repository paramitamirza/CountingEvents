Ali Syed , Alleged California Shooting Rampage Killer , Left Suicide Note : Police
TUSTIN , Calif. —
A Southern California college student who fatally shot three people last month before turning the gun on himself wrote a suicide note on his computer indicating the violence was premeditated , authorities said Friday .

The note , found during a forensic examination of Ali Syed 's computer , was written within an hour of when police say Syed shot and killed his first victim , a 20-year - old aspiring actress , said Orange County sheriff 's Investigator Dan Salcedo .

It showed no evidence , however , of a relationship between Syed , 20 , and his three victims , and detectives still believe they were random targets , Salcedo said .

The note showed that Syed had suicidal thoughts and " ideations and premeditations of these random acts of violence " but did n't mention any specific victims , locations or weapons , the investigator said .

Authorities declined to provide more details on the contents of the note .

Deputies found Courtney Aoki dead of multiple gunshot wounds before dawn on Feb. 19 at the home Syed shared with his parents in Ladera Ranch , a prosperous bedroom community in southern Orange County .

As Syed 's parents placed a panicked 911 call , Syed sped away in their black SUV and went on to kill two drivers during carjackings , shoot up cars on a busy freeway interchange and injure at least three others before shooting himself in the head , police said .

Investigators still do n't know how Aoki got to Syed 's house or what she was doing there .
They also do n't know what time she arrived and are n't sure if she was at the house when Syed wrote his note , Salcedo said .

Syed used a shotgun in his rampage that was given to him by his father as a gift a year earlier , police have said .

Syed , an unemployed part - time community college student , spent hours in his room playing video games , police have said .

The note did not make any mention of video games , Salcedo said .

Earlier this week , police detectives in Tustin – where one of the three victims was killed – issued a search warrant for cellphone records of Syed and victim Jeremy Lewis .

Police want to determine if they two had any prior contact , said Lt .
Paul Garaven .
He declined to provide more details .
