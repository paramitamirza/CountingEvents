 LOGAN SQUARE â€”
Someone opened fire on a family standing outside a house party in Logan Square Monday evening , hitting a 6-year - old girl in her back and leaving her in critical condition .

Around 8:10 p.m. , the girl was outside the party in the 2100 block of North Bingham Street when someone drove up and fired multiple shots out their window before fleeing , according to Officer Hector Alfaro , a Chicago Police spokesman .

One witness said she heard as many as nine shots .

" I was inside alone , and I heard people driving up and then , boom boom boom boom ! " said Ana D - J , who declined to say her full last name .
" Then everyone started screaming .
I went out and saw a little girl on the ground bleeding , and someone picked her up .
Then I screamed too . "

A relative brought the girl to St. Mary 's Hospital , and she was later transferred to Stroger Hospital , Alfaro said .
She was listed in critical condition with a gunshot wound in her back , police said .

The shooting happened in a normally quiet corner of Logan Square .
A short walk from Chase Elementary School , the small section of neighborhood wedged between the edge of Logan Square and Bucktown is teeming with families .

Kids playing on the sidewalk and in the yards along nearby streets are a common sight , especially during summer months when ice cream trucks circle the blocks on a steady rotation .
A firehouse and the Shakespeare District police station are within walking distance .

But gang tags are also a common sight in the area .
One resident who lives around the corner on Stave Street said he never walks down Bingham Street because of a few houses on the block , but overall feels safe in the area after living there for a long time .

After the shooting , neighbors gathered in front of a nearby corner grocery store at Francis Place and Stave Street , exchanging what little information was known about the shooting as a helicopter circled above .

Two residents from down the block were worried about their friend who lives on Bingham Street and has a young daughter .
They asked a young boy who lives on the corner of Bingham Street and Francis Place to describe the victim , to make sure it was n't their friend 's child .

Savannah , who declined to give her full name , moved into an apartment on the block a month earlier .
She heard 8 or 9 shots while sitting in her living room followed by people screaming , " like how you 'd react when a little girl is shot , " she said .

Savannah slammed her own window shut and noticed four men walking off quickly down Bingham and turning north on Francis , away from the shooting , she said .

" They shot Betsy , " she heard someone scream repeatedly .
" It 's really traumatic , not knowing the outcome " of the girl 's wounds , Savannah said .

Despite the shooting , Savannah said she " really loves living over here . "
After hearing the shots , she joined nearby neighbors from her building who were also concerned and the sense of community " made me feel safe . "

Simon Fernandez , who 's lived on the block since 1986 , said neighbors have long been concerned about the house where the shooting happened .

" The rest of the block is good , but that one has been a problem for years and years , " said Fernandez , a retired construction worker who was tending his outdoor garden when the shots rang out .
" They 're always making noise , partying , arguing , drinking and sometimes shooting . "

Tuesday morning , as Ana D - J walked her 11-year - old granddaughter to school , she wondered aloud whether anything could be done to stop the violence .

" Everybody on this block 's got kids , and we want to know if they can still be safe to play outside , " she said .
" These guys come around shooting sometimes , and we 're always praying nothing happens to any of the kids .
Well , it happened . "

After 12 years living on the block with her granddaughter , D - J said , it may be time for the family to move .

" I do n't know where we 're going to go , " she said , " but it 's got to be far , far away from here . "
