A firefighter who had been reported to be unarmed when he took down a 14-year - old accused in a school shooting was actually carrying a handgun , the sheriff revealed Monday .

Jamie Brock , 30-year veteran volunteer firefighter , confronted Jesse Osborne , who is accused of killing his father and a first - grader and wounding a teacher and another 6-year - old on Wednesday .

Brock was the first to reach Townville Elementary School Wednesday afternoon after Osborne opened fire on the playground , authorities said .

Fire Chief Billy McAdams said he and Brock were at his nearby farm when they heard the call about the shooting , and they raced to the school , getting there before deputies .

Chief 's first - person account of shooting , takedown

The Townville Volunteer Fire Department is just down the road from the school .
Brock got to the elementary school moments before other officers could respond to a 911 call .

By the time Brock reached the playground , first - grade teacher Meghan Hollingsworth and Jacob Hall and another boy had been wounded .

McAdams said Brock took the shooter down , and he did not mention the gun .

Officials would not comment on whether Brock ’s gun remained holstered or if it was used in the takedown .

Hollingsworth and the other first - grader were treated and released the day of the shooting .

Jacob suffered a severe brain injury caused by blood loss and died over the weekend .

Brock has not spoken publicly about the shooting , but he released a statement saying : " The true heroes of ( the ) senseless tragedy are the teachers that put their lives on the line to protect their students , the principal who through fears of her own did what ’s right to ensure the safety of the school .
They deserve to be called heroes , and to them I tip my hat . "
