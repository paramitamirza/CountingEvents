A 17-year - old boy has been charged with second - degree murder after Pierce County prosecutors say he mistakenly shot and killed a friend while intending to fire at another target .

The News Tribune of Tacoma reports the teen pleaded not guilty Friday in the death of 17-year - old Jatarius Tolbert .
He is being held on $ 1 million bail .

Court records show Tolbert was shot as he was hanging out in a Tacoma parking lot May 11 with other young men .
Someone in Tolbert 's group fired a gun at a car as it passed , and his acquaintances told police someone inside the car returned fire .

Prosecutors say the state crime lab later determined the bullet that killed Tolbert came from a revolver police found on the suspect when they stopped a car he was in a few days later .

Detectives who interviewed the suspect reportedly said he was despondent over accidentally shooting his friend .
