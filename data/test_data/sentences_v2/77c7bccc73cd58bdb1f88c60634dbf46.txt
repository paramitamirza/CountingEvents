Four shot , two dead in Pigtown shooting
BALTIMORE - Friends arrived and reacted to the news even six hours into the crime scene at the corner of South Carey and Carroll Streets in Pigtown .

Four were shot in the home , police say William Monroe and Meghan Kerrigan were killed ; the young couple 's baby , their first , miraculously not injured .

" They were good people .
I just do n't understand why somebody would go in the house and just randomly start shooting with a child in the bedroom with the mother and father . "

Ann Sands lives just one door down and is very close with Kerrigan and Monroe .

She says the suspect busted in through this window and went on an odd shooting rampage .

"
She said when the guy busted through the window , he said â€˜
I am the reaper . '
Then he went upstairs and started shooting , " said Sands
,
 Neighbors say the suspect then fled , but almost immediately returned to the crime scene and sat on the couch until police arrived , they would arrest Melville Mason without incident .

Mason is well known on this block , many say he went by the name PJ and lives on the corner just below Kim Poe .

" He was one of these , he was going to rule the block .
I mean how can you rule the block .
He 's only been here three years and I 've lived upstairs over ten and I 've never had any trouble out of anybody until he moved in , " said Poe .

But why he would shoot and kill this young couple with a 17 month old baby neighbors can only guess .

There is some talk about a fight that goes back to last week , but Baltimore police will only rely on their predictable refrain that this was a targeted shooting and not random .

That proved out to be the case , but it is of little comfort for those who had to watch the scene unfold .

" My best friend is gone , her boyfriend 's gone and there is a child without a mother and father .
This is sad , " said Sands .

The two others that were shot this morning include Monroe 's mother and a family friend .

At first , the couple 's neighbor Ann Sands was taking care of their baby who again was unharmed ; we are told she is now in the care of her other grandmother .
