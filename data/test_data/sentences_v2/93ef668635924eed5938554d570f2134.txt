By Russell Mills
 A gathering in a small apartment occupied by students of a well - known technical college in Tulsa turned deadly Thursday night , and while we know much more about what happened , the question of motive remains unanswered .

Police say Mark Hopkins , 41 , a resident of the Spartan Landing apartment complex near E. Pine St. and S. Mingo Ave .
opened fire about 9:00 p.m. , shooting and killing Chaz Fain , 18 .

Three other men in the apartment , two eighteen years old , one nineteen , were also shot but survived .

Hopkins then fled into the cold night , without even a jacket , and was arrested less than 90 minutes later in a nearby parking lot .

According to an arrest and booking report obtained by KRMG , he confessed to the shooting after police read him his rights .

However , in a statement to KRMG , Det .
Sgt .
Dave Walker of TPD says they do n't know Hopkins ' motive for the shootings .

All five men knew one another from attending classes at the Spartan School of Aeronautics , located just north of the apartment complex .

Residents there tell KRMG only students of the school live at Spartan Landing .

Hopkins and two of the surviving victims lived in the apartment where the shootings occurred .

Fain and the other surviving victim also lived in the complex , but not in that apartment , Walker tells KRMG.
 Police say Hopkins came to Tulsa from Alabama , Fain from Florida .

The Spartan School attracts students from around the world .
