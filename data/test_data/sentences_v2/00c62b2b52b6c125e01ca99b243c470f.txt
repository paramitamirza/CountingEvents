INDIANAPOLIS —
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police detectives are investigating the deaths of four people who were found shot multiple times in a home that was broken into and ransacked .

The owner of a home called police around 9:45 a.m. Tuesday after she discovered the four victims , three woman and one man , officer Chris Wilburn said .

Televisions were toppled over in the home , which Wilburn said was " ransacked . "
He said there were signs the suspect or suspects forced their way into the residence .

Police did not immediately say who the victims are or how they are connected to the female homeowner .

A crowd of people gathered in the neighborhood throughout the morning and afternoon waiting for information about the victims .
Some cried and appeared anguished .
One woman vomited on the street .

"
Please bear with us , " Police Chief Rick Hite told the anxious group at one point .

Hite said investigators were treating the case as they would if the victims were their own family members , and slowly and carefully combing the home for clues .

Comforting his family members on the street , Charles Richardson said his sister was the person who discovered the victims .
He said he was called to his sister 's house Tuesday morning , unsure of what he would find .

Police allowed him to cross the crime scene tape to be with his sister , who he said was distraught .

" I comforted her , " Richardson said , standing outside on his sister 's street .

But she could n't elaborate on what she saw , he said .
Like the rest of the group , Richardson said he was waiting to learn who the victims are .

" We are praying , " he said .

Police initially described the shootings as " execution style , " but Hite later said that description was not accurate .

Investigators said each victim was shot multiple times , but would not say where they were hit .

" There were a significant amount of shots , " Wilburn said .

Hite said detectives were " pursuing information . "

Hite did not say whether police had any suspects , but he said investigators believe the incident was not a random act of violence .

The neighborhood is near one of six focus areas highlighted by the police department last year for extra attention because of their disproportionate amount of violent crime .

Michael Coleman , a resident of the neighborhood , said North Harding Street appeared normal Tuesday morning until police rushed to the area .

He said he was rattled by the police activity .

" I 'm trying to get out of here in the next month , " said Coleman .

Other neighbors echoed his sentiment .

Stanley Brown , a 59-year - old lifelong Indianapolis resident , said he recently invested in vacant lots in a nearby neighborhood , hoping it would pay off if the neighborhood becomes targeted for redevelopment .

But he is now wondering if that investment was a mistake .

" I do n't know if I should try to hold onto it or sell it , " Brown said .

On Saturday less than a half mile away , a man shot and killed his brother because he believed he was shooting an intruder .
