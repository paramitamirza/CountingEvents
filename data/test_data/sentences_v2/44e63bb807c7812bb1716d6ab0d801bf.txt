La. toddler picks up dad 's gun , dies from gunshot
Family Handout Alexis Mercer , 3 , died when she picked up her dad 's gun and accidentally shot herself .

Funeral services will be held Friday in Louisiana for little Alexis Mercer , a chubby - cheeked toddler who picked up a handgun her father had left in the living room and shot herself with it .

The 3-year - old died at a nearby hospital in Calcasieu Parrish on Monday .
She had just returned home with her mother and two siblings when she picked up the weapon that was unlocked and in plain sight , along with two rifles and another handgun .

" It makes me angry , " Sheriff Tony Mancuso told KPLC - TV. "
It makes my heart hurt .
It 's just something that should n't happen . "

The girl 's father had been cleaning his guns while his wife and three children were out , the sheriff said .

For some reason , the man failed to put way the weapons , leaving them in the living room , out in the open .
Then he went to work .

When the mother came home with her 1-year - old , 2-year - old and Alexis , the eldest child managed to grab one of the handguns and fire it .

" This is a moment as a sheriff that I have to tell people , ' You have got to protect our children , ' ''
Mancuso said .

Every gun sold in the state comes with a lock , the sheriff said .
People should use them .

The solution , he said , could n't be simpler .
Lock your guns .
Or put them in a lock box .

The local prosecutor 's office is investigating the shooting death .
