" It just happened out of nowhere , " said Mary Rodriguez , a neighborhood resident .
" The guy came running from the alleyway and just started shooting everybody , shooting at anybody who was out here .
It was crazy . "

The victim said he did n't recognize the gunman , and described him as a black man wearing a black shirt .

" I was at the wrong place at the wrong time yesterday , " he said .

Two of the other three victims were last reported to be in serious condition .

Police returned to the neighborhood on Tuesday in search of clues as they work to identify the shooter .

It 's a shame what this world is coming to , " Rodriguez said .
" There 's a whole bunch of kids every day on this block , and I 'm talking about little , little kids . "
