On Monday morning , the message “
Pray for our school and community ” was posted outside of Bunker Hill High School , and counselors planned to speak with students following the death of a third classmate in the past month .

Just two weeks ago , students spray painted the rock in front of the school to honor two classmates killed in a car crash .

As the school week starts , they will be mourning the loss of yet another classmate .

The Catawba County Sheriff 's Office said Austin Hedrick , 16 , was in the cab of a pickup truck with his father and 15-year - old friend .
The truck was traveling down Hudson Chapel Road near Browns Chapel Road near midnight .
Deputies said a high - caliber hunting rifle went off , killing Austin .

Investigators are still looking into how it happened but believe it was accidental .

Channel 9 spoke with Austin ’s family , who said the sophomore loved life , and they want to celebrate that life .

" We 're taking it minute by minute , day by day , " said John Hedrick , Austin 's uncle .
" It 's really hard to process . "

Austin played football and wrestled and was very involved in his church , his family said .

" He sang at church , he loved to sing and dance , " said Linda Hedrick , Austin 's grandmother .
"
He loved to praise the Lord and I know that 's where he 's at now . "

The latest incident to rock the Catawba County community comes just two weeks after Bunker Hill students Alec Sigmon and Justin Turner were killed in a car crash .
Two other students and a recent graduate were also injured in that crash on River Bend Road on Oct. 3 .

The school is cancelling this week 's “ Spirit Week ” activities leading to Friday ’s Homecoming following Austin ’s death , and grief counselors will be on hand to help students cope with the tragedy .

School officials said they chose to cancel the activities to create a respectful atmosphere for those who are grieving .

The game and other Homecoming activities will still take place Friday night .
