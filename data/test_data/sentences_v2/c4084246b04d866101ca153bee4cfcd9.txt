Lexington police say a 14-year - old was seriously injured in an accidental shooting Tuesday night .

The shooting happened around 7:30 p.m. at the Raintree Apartments on North Locust Hill Drive .

Police say the 14-year - old and two other teenagers were playing with a gun in one of the apartments , when the gun accidentally fired , hitting the victim in the neck .
The parents of the teenager who shot the gun were not home when the shooting happened .

Police tell WKYT that after the shooting happened , the teen responsible left the scene .
Originally , police were investigating the case as a drive - by shooting because of information they were given .

However , it was n't long until the teenager responsible told police the truth .

" His parents showed up and spoke to him .
After they spoke to him , he realized that he needed to be telling the truth .
So the parents came up to us and advised us that he was willing to give us a different story at that time , " Lt .
Jackie Newman said .

Police say the teenager was taken to UK Hospital , where as of 8:30 p.m. , he was in surgery .
Police say his condition is stable .

Lexington police are still investigating the shooting , but at this point , they say no charges have been filed .

" We 're more concerned about the condition of the 14-year - old and we believe at this time , that the reason the story was given is because they were trying to protect their friend who was involved in the incident- did n't want him to get in any trouble , " Lt .
Newman said .
