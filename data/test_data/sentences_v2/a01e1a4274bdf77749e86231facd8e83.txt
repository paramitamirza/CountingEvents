 Phoenix police have identified the 19-year - old victim of a deadly shooting that happened at a house party on the city 's southwest side .

Nora Osman died as a result of the shooting Saturday night at 5800 South 53rd Glen , said Phoenix police Sgt .
Trent Crump .
Three others , an 18-year - old woman and two men , ages 21 and 22 , were treated for wounds and released .

On Sunday night , dozens from the south Phoenix community marched to where Osman was killed to remember her life and demand justice .

" She was a great person , " Osman 's sister , Radwa Osman , said .
" She did n't deserve to die . "

Police say the shooting happened as a house party of more than 100 people was breaking up and some kind of altercation occurred .
They said shots were fired from multiple directions .
 "
[ The shooting and altercation ] had nothing to do with her , " Radwa Osman said .
" She was at the wrong place at the wrong time . "

All of the victims were shot outside of the house and the suspects were believed to have fled in a vehicle ; however , there were numerous vehicles leaving at the time , Crump said .
It also appears that shots might also have been fired from someone on foot , he added .

In 2010 , the city of Phoenix created a Community Engagement and Outreach Team , whose task was to work with police to curb violent crimes specifically in south Phoenix , the same area Nora Osman was killed .

A member of that team , Shawn Pearson , said that group made significant changes but violent crimes like Saturday 's shooting serves as a reminder that there 's still progress to be made .

" [ Teens ] are doing these things out of ridiculous motives but they 're doing them nonetheless , " Pearson said .
" We 've got to give them something to hope for . "

Investigators have not released any suspect or suspect vehicle descriptions at this point .

Nora Osman 's mother told CBS5 News her daughter was in college and studying to become a pediatrician .

Deqa Osman is asking the community to help bring her daughter 's killer to justice and for the violence to stop .

" I know whatever we do or whatever happens - it 's not going to bring my kid back , " she said .
" But , I do n't want it [ violence ] to happen no more . "

The Osman family is asking for donations to help with funeral costs .
If you would like to donate , stop by any Chase Bank and give to the Nora Osman fund .
The account number is 763187648 .

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Phoenix Police Department or Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS OR 480-TESTIGO.
