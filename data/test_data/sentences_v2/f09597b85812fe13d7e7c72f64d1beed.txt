The people of Lancaster County are known for their generosity .
It ’s why the refugee program is so successful here .
There are people here who are willing to help , and who see meeting the practical needs of another human being as an outward expression of faith .

From today ’s LNP editorial , “
A photo reminds us of Lancaster County ’s history of helping children like Omran , ” ( click here ) .

Here ’s an idea , LNP !
Instead of writing these platitudes day after day and doing the exact opposite , why don’t you investigate the murder of Ibram Hanna ?
Why don’t you do something to help ?
Why don’t you send a reporter to Mountville and why don’t you question the West Hempfield Township police and the DA ’s office ?
Why don’t you do your job and hold these officials accountable ?

Why don’t you do it today !

THE FAMILY DESERVES
 ANSWERS AND JUSTICE !

Ibram Hanna

They left Egypt to avoid Christian persecution and worship God without fear of death .
To keep their family safe .
Only to lose a son in such a violent way .
They deserve love , respect , justice and support .

Posted on social media about the family of Ibram Hanna , 15 , who was shot to death in Mountville on August 12 .

This family needs justice .
The West Hempfield Township Police and the District Attorney ’s Office need to be investigated for their handling of this murder and this travesty of justice .

George Rosado , a very troubled 17-year - old being raised by his grandmother , with a stolen gun , with several teens in his house , pulls the trigger and shoots Ibram dead between the eyes at approximately 10:30 am in the morning .
Before 10:00 pm that night , the DA ’s office issues a statement essentially closing the case – stating it was an accident and Rosado will be charged as a juvenile and the public will learn nothing further about this case or his punishment .

That is not going to happen .
This is unacceptable .
This is the direct antithesis of how American justice is supposed to operate .
The Hanna family deserves answers and justice .

Email or call Brett Hambright , the DA ’s “ media specialist ” and tell him to tell District Attorney Craig Stedman to reopen this investigation now or bring in outside help !
