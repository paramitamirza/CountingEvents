Shooter in fatal Caledonia hunting accident identified
A supervisor at the regional office in Avon told us that , despite recent cases , hunting - related deaths are actually down from where they used to be .

" If you look at the statistics of the state , they 've been on decline since the 60s and 70s , and I think 2014 was the safest on record in New York State , " says Lt .
Joshua Verhague of the DEC.
 Lt . Verhague says that 's because hunters receive more safety training -- whether through a class or a step - by - step guide to using your firearm .

" The Ten Commandments of Firearm Safety -- we ca n't stress enough for hunters , as well as non - hunters , when carrying a firearm , " he says , " the safety aspect of it . "

Lieutenant Verhague would not comment specifically about the case in Caledonia , but did say most hunting - related deaths are avoidable .

" Make sure you know your target and your target environment , " says Lt .
Verhague .
" Keep your finger outside the trigger guard and off the trigger at all times until you 're on target and have made the conscious decision to fire . "

Investigators say alcohol does not appear to have been a factor .
At this point , no charges have been filed .
