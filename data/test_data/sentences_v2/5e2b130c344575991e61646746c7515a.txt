Dad charged after son accidentally shoots , kills little brother
GOODLETTSVILLE , Tenn. ( WKRN ) –
A Goodlettsville father has been indicted on two felonies in the accidental shooting death of his 5-year - old son .

It happened on Nov. 21 just before Thanksgiving after the child ’s big brother got a hold of the father ’s loaded handgun and pulled the trigger .

The 5-year - old boy was hit in the head and died at the family ’s apartment off Moss Trail .

Their father , 31-year - old Robert Turner , is charged with felony criminal negligent homicide and reckless endangerment .

Police say it was his semi - automatic handgun with a laser site that was used in the accidental shooting .

Turner is accused of messing around with the laser , pointing it at the wall so their cat could chase it .

He allegedly put the gun down for 30 seconds when his 7-year - old picked it up and accidentally pulled the trigger , killing his little brother .

Nashville self - defense expert Buford Tune told News 2 that a gun is nothing to be played with , laser or no laser .
 “
You have a semi - automatic , it has a light trigger , usually a 5 to 5.5-pound trigger any kid can press , ”
Tune said .

“ Leaving it laying there , I have a big problem with that , ” he added .

Tune says education is the key .

“
You can say , ‘
Stop !
Don’t touch it !
Go tell an adult !
Get away from it .
Don’t pick it up !
Don’t touch it ; go tell someone!’ ” he explained .

Turner is scheduled to be in Davidson County court on Jan 13 .
for his arraignment .
