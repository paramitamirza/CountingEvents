 CHICAGO â€”
A shooting Thursday afternoon in Humboldt Park left a 10-year - old girl and two men wounded , police said .

At 12:40 p.m. , Tyra Ruffin was sitting on her grandmother 's porch in the 4100 block of West Potomac Avenue with her father and his friend when two men emerged from a gangway and started shooting , police and witnesses said .

Tyra was taken to Norwegian American Hospital after sustaining a graze wound and was in fair condition , according to Officer Bari Lemmon , a Chicago Police spokeswoman .

The girl was back home less than three hours after the shooting , clinging to her grandmother with a small band - aid on her forearm .

Tyra 's father , 30-year - old Travis Ruffin , had a bullet go through his right arm into his chest and was also hit in the left arm , Lemmon said .
He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in serious condition .

The other man , 25 , was hit in the ankles and was taken to Stroger Hospital in fair condition , Lemmon said .

Tyra had been sitting in her father 's lap when the shots rang out , she said .

" I heard the gunshots , and then I heard my dad say ' Get on the ground , ' " she said .
As she ran inside the house , she realized she was bleeding from her arm .

" When I saw her she was all ' Ahhh , " said Tyra 's grandmother , Yvette Ruffin .
" Then I was like , ' Ohhhh , that 's a bullet . '
It skimmed her . "

Hours after the shooting , Yvette stood in front of her brownstone two - flat with her arm wrapped tightly around Tyra 's shoulders , as more of her grandchildren scurried and played around her .

" That 's a nip , " Yvette told her granddaughter , giving her a gentle squeeze .
" You ai n't get shot , you just got nipped . "

But Yvette did n't want to take any chances , she said .
She wanted to leave the city , and take her family with her .

" We hear shots all the time , " Yvette said .
" We got to make them go in the house .
It 's dangerous . "

Tyra said she wanted to move away , too .

" I do n't like it here , " she said quietly , eyes fixed at the ground .

Nanette Rios was in her basement apartment below the porch when she heard the shots ring out , she said .
Her 11-year - old son , Devin Henderson , was playing video games when she grabbed him by his shirt and pushed him into a closet to wait for the gunfire to end .

" I almost got shot , " Devin said Thursday afternoon , scowling .
He stood barefoot in front of his home , clutching a kids ' version of the Bible .
His finger bookmarked a page titled " Passages to read when you 're scared . "

Devin said he hears gunshots on the block constantly .

" I just feel like everything is wrong in the world , " he said .
" I feel like everything is going to pieces . "

Rios stood next to her son , beaming down at him .

" This got to stop , for real , " she said .
" We got kids out here , you know .
We 're all families here .
That 's so wrong for them to shoot like this . "

Police said both of the men shot were documented gang members .

" It might have been gang - related , I do n't know , " Yvette Ruffin said of the shooting .

No one was in custody , police said .

On average , nearly one child 13 or younger has been shot every week in Chicago this year , according to the Tribune .

An 8-year - old girl was shot in Austin on Aug. 21 , police said .
A week earlier , a 6-year - old girl was shot in Pullman .

She was one of at least four 6-year - old girls shot in Chicago this summer .

A girl was shot along with her uncle , who died , in Park Manor in early August .
In mid - July , a 6-year - old girl playing near her Englewood home was struck when she was caught in a crossfire of bullets .

Another 6-year - old girl was shot in Logan Square in June .
