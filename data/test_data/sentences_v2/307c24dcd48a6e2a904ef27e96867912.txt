Seattle - area blood bank sued by transgender woman
SEATTLE —
A transgender woman has filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against a Seattle - based blood bank , saying she was fired after changing her donor profile to female to match her reissued birth certificate .

In the lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District court in Tacoma , Stephanie Binschus alleges Bloodworks Northwest treated her differently than other employees even though she made sure the company was fully aware of her transition .

A long - time donor to the organization formerly known as the Puget Sound Blood Center before her transition and before becoming an employee , Binschus was accused of falsifying her donor record after the organization changed its policy on gender identification , according to her attorney , Jillian T. Weiss .

“
I think It ’s important for employers to understand that a transgender woman is a woman .
Whatever they may have been thinking about who she is , according to the state of Washington , she is a female , ” Weiss said .
“ To be fired because she says so is a violation .

 David A. Larsen , a spokesman for Bloodworks , said the organiztaion could not comment on matters under litigation .

According to the U.S. Employment Opportunity Commission , discrimination complaints from transgender individuals still represent a minority of gender identity and sexual orientation complaints but they have been increasing .
More than 200 federal complaints were filed in fiscal 2014 , which ended in March 2015 .

Between being hired in October 2013 as a blood collection specialist in Silverdale , Washington , and fired in February 2014 , Binschus alleges in the lawsuit her fellow employees made Bloodworks an uncomfortable place to work .

She was told to remove books and pamphlets related to gender identity from the office because a co - worker considered them controversial .
She was accused of letting her advocacy interfere with her work .
And she was referred to as “
his/her ” in an email from a superior , according to the lawsuit .

She also believes she was treated differently than other non - transgender employees when the organization disciplined her for a violation of procedure by firing her instead of a reprimand .

The lawsuit is asking for retraining of blood bank staff on issues related to sex discrimination and monetary damages for loss of income , humiliation and damage to her reputation .
