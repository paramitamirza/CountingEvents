The shootings took place at a mobile home in the 16000 block of Bachmann Avenue in Hudson .

The sheriff ’s office had not revealed the names of the brothers late Wednesday .

Stressing that the details were still preliminary , the sheriff said the 16-year - old called 911 at 6:19 p.m. and told dispatchers he had been shot .

Deputies were the first responders who arrived at the mobile home and found the 13-year - old and 6-year - old dead and the 16-year - old with a gunshot wound , Nocco said .

“ This is a horrific scene,’’ Nocco said .

The sheriff said the account of what happened came from the 16-year - old boy .
The boys’ mother , and another older brother were not home at the time of the shooting , Nocco said .

Nocco said he did not know how seriously the 16-year - old was wounded but that he was alive and was taken to a hospital .
