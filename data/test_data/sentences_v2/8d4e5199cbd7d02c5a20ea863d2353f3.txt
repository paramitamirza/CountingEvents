2 men busted in shooting that wounded 5 , killing unborn baby
Two men were busted and a third was still being sought late Tuesday in a gang - related drive - by shooting that left five people wounded , including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby was killed .

Cops say the wild gunplay , which popped off around 10:50 p.m. on Monday , was retaliation for a shooting at the Gowanus Houses in Brooklyn that happened earlier that morning .

Expectant mom , Special - Caijae Houston , 19 , was hit by five bullets when the shots rang out on Dwight St. , across from the Red Hook Houses .
She was in critical condition at Lutheran Medical Center on Tuesday , but expected to survive .
Houston , in critical condition , was hit once in the midsection , once in the right ribs , once in the left wrist and twice in the buttocks , cops said .

The camp counselor was five months pregnant .
She hadn’t chosen a name for the baby .
She didn’t know the gender .

Marquise Frederick , 19 , is wanted by police for the shooting that killed one and injured four on Monday night .
 “
She has a long road ahead of her , but she ’s gonna pull through , ” her mother , Tamara Joyner , 41 , said .

Investigators say three women , including Houston , and two men were hit in the barrage of bullets in Brooklyn .
One of the men was the target , a police source said .

Cops late Tuesday arrested two of the three men—the driver and a passenger—who were in an SUV tied to the shooting .
Their names weren’t immediately released .

Police were still looking for 19-year - old Marquise Frederick who was believed to have been one of the shooters .
Frederick , who has three prior arrests , runs with the Ow Ow Crew , who claim the Gowanus Houses as their turf , Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said .
He was gunning for a member of the Gangsta Money Makers based at the Red Hook Houses .

“ What we have is two individuals who alight from a car , an SUV , another male driving , ”
Boyce said .
“
They get out of the car and they fire into the crowd .
”

Hand Out Special - Caijae Houston , who was five months pregnant , wound up soaking up five of the bullets in the shooting .

The five victims were hanging out on the front porch of a Dwight St. residence and eating Chinese takeout just before the shooting , relatives said .
Devin Callahan , who is Houston ’s boyfriend , had just returned from basketball practice while Houston and a pal had been at a dance class , they said .

Then all hell broke loose .

“
There 's Chinese food and blood everywhere , " said Callahan ’s 31-year - old sister , Danielle Smith .
“ When I went downstairs everyone was on the floor on top of each other .
”
 Callahan shed no light on the shooting when he was released from Lutheran after being treated for gunshot wounds to both thighs .

" I 'm all right , " Callahan , 20 , said as he left the hospital in a wheelchair .
" I 'll be all right . "

The other wounded are :
 - Callahan ’s 22-year - old sister , Deanna Smith , who was shot in the leg .
She was treated and released from New York Methodist Hospital .

- Destiny Jones , 19 , who was in stable condition at Lutheran .

“ She 's good , just her leg was broken , ”
friend Sheantty Braddy said .
“ She got five in the leg and one in the neck .
It just grazed her neck .
”

- Jemini Mitchell , 20 .
He was also in stable condition at Lutheran after having been shot multiple times .
