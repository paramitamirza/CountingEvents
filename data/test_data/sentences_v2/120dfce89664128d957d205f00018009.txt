On May 23 , 2014 , in Isla Vista , California , 22-year - old Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured fourteen others near the campus of University of California , Santa Barbara , before taking his own life .

The attack began when Rodger stabbed three men to death in his apartment .
Afterwards , he drove to a sorority house and shot three female students outside , killing two .
He drove to a nearby deli and shot to death a male student who was inside .
He began to speed through Isla Vista , shooting and wounding several pedestrians and striking several others with his car .
Rodger exchanged gunfire with police twice during the attack , receiving a non - fatal gunshot to the hip .
The rampage ended when his car crashed into a parked vehicle and came to a stop .
Police found him dead in the car with a self - inflicted gunshot wound to the head .

Before driving to the sorority house , Rodger uploaded to YouTube a video titled " Elliot Rodger 's Retribution " , in which he outlined details of his upcoming attack and his motives .
He explained that he wanted to punish women for rejecting him and to punish sexually - active men for living a more enjoyable life than his .

After uploading the video , Rodger e - mailed a lengthy autobiographical manuscript to approximately a dozen acquaintances and family members .
The document , which he titled " My Twisted World " , was made available on the Internet and became widely known as his " manifesto " .
In it , he described his childhood , family conflicts , frustration over not being able to find a girlfriend , his hatred of women , his contempt for racial minorities and interracial couples , and his plans for what he described as " retribution " .

Events [ edit ]

Preparation [ edit ]

In September 2012 , Rodger visited a shooting range to train himself in firing handguns.[1 ]
In November 2012 , he purchased his first handgun , a Glock 34 pistol , in Goleta , after doing research on handguns .
As documented in his manifesto , he assessed the Glock 34 as " an efficient and highly accurate weapon."[2 ]

In early 2013 , Rodger bought two additional handguns , both SIG Sauer P226 pistols , writing that they were " of a much higher quality than the Glock " and " a lot more efficient".[1 ]
He purchased the weapons in Oxnard and Burbank.[3 ]

According to his manifesto , Rodger had saved $ 5,000 of pocket money , which was given to him by his parents and grandmothers , in order to purchase the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks.[1][4 ] Gun law experts have said that there was nothing in his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.[5 ]

 Attacks [ edit ]
 Rodger began his attacks at his apartment on Seville Road , where three men were found dead inside.[6][7 ] Each victim had received multiple stab wounds,[6][7][8 ] and all had been killed approximately three hours before the shooting spree .
Their bodies were found the day following the shootings .
They were identified as Rodger 's roommates , Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong , and a friend named George Chen.[9 ]
 Faint bloodstains in the main hallway of the apartment indicate at least one of the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment .
Authorities later said that the presence of a blood - soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder .
The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom , whereas Chen 's body was found in the bathroom.[9 ] The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered , and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets , towels , and clothing.[10 ] Police removed a knife , a hammer , and two machetes from the apartment,[11][12 ] but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger 's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.[9 ]

Less than two hours preceding the shooting spree , Rodger went to a Starbucks coffee shop , where he purchased some coffee.[9 ]
He was later seen sitting in his car in the parking lot of his apartment building at about 8:30 p.m.,[13 ] working on his laptop .
He uploaded the " Retribution " video at 9:17 p.m. , and sent his manifesto e - mail at 9:18 p.m.[14 ]

Rodger drove to the Alpha Phi sorority house at Embarcadero del Norte and Segovia Road near the University of California Santa Barbara.[note 1 ]
He knocked on the sorority house door for a few minutes.[17 ]
After no one answered , he began shooting people who were nearby .
He first shot three Delta Delta Delta sorority sisters , killing two of them and wounding the third.[18][19][20 ]
Responding sheriff 's deputies and nearby pedestrians ran to the victims and tried to tend to their wounds before ambulances arrived.[9 ]

After returning to his car , Rodger drove two blocks onto Pardall Road and fired once at a coffee shop as he went eastbound .
The shop was closed and unoccupied at the time , and no one was injured by the gunshot .
He then arrived at the Isla Vista Deli Mart and fired several gunshots into the building , fatally shooting a student inside.[9 ] His car was seen leaving the scene by four responding foot - patrol officers , but they did not identify him as the shooter and he escaped without incident.[18][21][22 ]
 Rodger drove south on Embarcadero del Norte on the wrong side of the street , striking a pedestrian crossing the street and firing at two others on the sidewalk but missing both .
Embarcadero del Norte curves near a 7-Eleven convenience store , forming " The Loop " , where he continued firing , hitting a couple exiting a pizzeria and then a female bicyclist.[9][23][24][25][26][27 ]
He drove south on El Embarcadero and shot at and missed a woman,[28 ] turned east on Del Playa Drive , then made a U - turn and drove west , where he exchanged fire with a sheriff 's deputy , who was responding to a 9:27 p.m. 9 - 1 - 1 call , and struck two pedestrians.[9 ]
Students at the Isla Vista Church , on Del Playa near Camino del Sur , were finishing a worship service at the time and heard gunfire.[21][22][26][29 ]

Turning north on Camino del Sur , Rodger shot and wounded three people at Sabado Tarde , and also struck a skateboarder and two bicyclists with his car .
Turning east on Sabado Tarde , he struck a skateboarder with his car and shot two other men at the intersection with Camino Pescadero.[9 ]
On Sabado Tarde near Little Acorn Park , he again exchanged gunfire , this time with three sheriff 's deputies , and was shot in the left hip.[6][20][21][22][30][note 2 ] Pursued by police,[9 ] he turned south a second time on El Embarcadero , then west again on Del Playa .
He struck a bicyclist , then crashed on the north sidewalk just east of the intersection of Del Playa and Camino Pescadero.[31][32 ]

Police found Rodger dead inside his vehicle from a self - inflicted gunshot wound to his head.[9 ]
He killed a total of six other people , and wounded fourteen others.[6][26][33][34 ]
 Aftermath [ edit ]

Police investigated a total of seventeen crime scenes .
A search of Rodger 's car recovered three pistols , the two knives used to kill the three men at the apartment , six empty ten - round magazines , and 548 rounds of unspent ammunition , all found in ten - round magazines or ammunition boxes .
A total of 83 spent shell casings were recovered from the crime scenes , 55 of which were fired from Rodger and the remaining 28 from sheriff 's deputies.[9 ] Rodger purchased the 9mm guns legally in three different cities.[6][8][27][35 ] Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said that there was video and written evidence suggesting the crime was premeditated and that preparations took over a year.[23][35][36 ]
 Officers from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff 's Office and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives began searches of the separate homes of Rodger 's mother and father in Los Angeles.[35 ]
 The media later reported the frantic attempt by Rodger 's parents to intervene on the evening of the killings .
After receiving a copy of the manifesto , Rodger 's therapist phoned his mother .
She checked his YouTube channel , where she found the " Retribution " video that he had uploaded minutes earlier .
She called Rodger 's father and they independently began to drive up to Isla Vista .
During the drive , she called police in Isla Vista and they arranged to meet the parents upon arrival .
Hearing a radio news report of a shooting in Isla Vista , his mother called the therapist , who told her it was unrelated , saying that Rodger promised to act the following day and it would be unlike him to deviate from such details .
When the parents reached the police station in Isla Vista , they learned that the news report was , in fact , about their son , and that he had killed six people.[37 ]

A month after the rampage , the parents of the stabbing victims expressed anger and frustration about multiple aspects of the case , including the failure of police to take preventive action before the attack , the limited amount of information that the authorities had released about their sons ' murders , more public interest in Rodger than in the victims , and perceived emphasis on the rights of the mentally ill over the rights of victims.[38 ] On March 2 , 2015 , the families of the stabbing victims filed a federal lawsuit against the county , the sheriff 's department , and the apartment building .
The suit alleged that the defendants failed to recognize warning signs and take action to prevent the tragedy.[39 ]

On February 18 , 2015 , the Santa Barbara County Sheriff 's Office released a 64-page final investigative summary report of the killings.[9][10 ]

 Fatalities [ edit ]

All six murder victims were students at the University of California , Santa Barbara ( UCSB).[21][46 ] They were declared dead at the scenes of their attacks.[18 ]
 The men killed at Rodger 's apartment were identified as George Chen ( Chinese : 陳喬治 ; pinyin : Chén Qiáozhì ) , 19 ; Cheng Yuan " James " Hong ( Chinese : 洪晟元 ; pinyin : Hóng Chéngyuán ) , 20 ; and Weihan " David " Wang ( Chinese : 王偉漢 ; pinyin : Wáng Wěihàn ) , 20.[47][48][49 ]
Hong and Chen were confirmed to be Rodger 's roommates according to an apartment lease , while police were investigating whether Wang was also a resident or visiting the apartment on the night of the killings.[8][50][51][52][note 3 ]
 The three students who died from gunshot wounds were identified as Katherine Breann Cooper , 22 ; Christopher Ross Michaels - Martinez , 20 ; and Veronika Elizabeth Weiss , 19.[46 ] Cooper and Weiss , both members of the Delta Delta Delta sorority , were killed outside the Alpha Phi sorority house , while Michaels - Martinez died inside the Isla Vista Deli Mart.[18][55 ]

On February 18 , 2015 , autopsy reports for all six slain victims were released by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff 's Office as part of a 64-page final investigative summary report:[9][10 ]

Fourteen other people were injured ; seven from gunshot wounds and seven by blunt trauma sustained when Rodger struck them with his vehicle.[9 ] [ 56 ] Eleven of the injured were taken to hospitals .
Seven went to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital , where two were admitted in serious condition , one in fair condition , and two others in good condition , and one patient was released on the same day .
The remaining four injured were taken to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital , where they were all treated and released.[12][19 ]

By June 14 , graduation day at UCSB , all surviving victims had been released from the hospitals .
Five attended graduation ceremonies.[43][57
] UCSB awarded posthumous degrees to the six slain students.[58 ]
 Perpetrator [ edit ]

Elliot Oliver Robertson Rodger[59 ] ( July 24 , 1991 – May 23 , 2014 ) was confirmed by police to be the sole perpetrator of the killings.[8][18][25][60 ]
 Early life and education [ edit ]

Rodger was born in London , England , and moved to the United States with his parents when he was five years old.[61 ]
He was raised in Los Angeles .
His mother is Li Chin Rodger , a Malaysian research assistant for a film company,[62][63 ] and his father is British filmmaker Peter Rodger , whose credits include working as a second unit assistant director for The Hunger Games.[64 ] A younger sister was born before his parents divorced .
After his father remarried , he and his second wife Soumaya Akaaboune , a Moroccan actress , had a son together.[65 ] Elliot Rodger 's paternal grandfather was photojournalist George Rodger.[60 ]
 Rodger attended Crespi Carmelite High School , an all - boys Catholic school in Encino , Los Angeles , and then Taft High School in Woodland Hills.[66 ]
He graduated from Independence Continuation High School in Lake Balboa in 2009.[66 ]
He moved to Isla Vista on June 4 , 2011.[9 ] Rodger attended Santa Barbara City College ( SBCC ) .
In his manifesto , he said that he dropped out of all his classes in February 2012.[1 ]
The school said he was no longer taking classes.[20 ]
 Mental health and social problems [ edit ]

According to his family 's attorney and a family friend , Rodger had seen multiple therapists since he was eight years old and while he was a student at SBCC.[20 ] The lawyer said that Rodger was " receiving psychiatric treatment",[37][67][68 ] but Rodger was never formally diagnosed with a mental illness.[69 ] A psychiatrist had prescribed him anti - psychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , but he refused to take it.[70 ]
According to Rodger 's mother , he was diagnosed as having Asperger syndrome , but a formal medical diagnosis of the disorder was not made.[71 ]

By the ninth grade , Rodger was " increasingly bullied , " and he wrote that he " cried by [ himself ] at school every day".[72 ] During his time at Crespi Carmelite High , he was bullied by other students including an incident that involved his head getting taped to his desk while he was asleep.[18][73 ]
According to Rodger , in 2012 , " the one friend [ he ] had in the whole world who truly understood [ him ] " " blatantly said he did n't want to be friends anymore " without offering him a reason for ending the friendship.[72 ]

Rodger had a YouTube account and a blog titled " Elliot Rodger 's Official Blog " , both of which contained posts expressing loneliness and rejection .
He wrote that he had been prescribed risperidone but refused to take it , stating , " After researching this medication , I found that it was the absolute wrong thing for me to take."[74 ]

After turning 18 , Rodger began rejecting the mental health care that his family provided , and he became increasingly isolated .
He said that he was unable to make friends although acquaintances said that he rebuffed their attempts to be friendly.[5 ]
 Screenwriter Dale Launer , who was a friend of the Rodger family , stated that he had counseled Rodger on approaching and befriending women , but that Rodger did not follow the advice .
He said in an interview , " I first met [ Rodger ] when he was aged eight or nine and I could see then that there was something wrong with him .
I 'm not a psychologist , but looking back now he strikes me as someone who was broken from the moment of conception."[75 ]
 Earlier incidents [ edit ]

In July 2011 , Rodger followed a couple he was jealous of out of a Starbucks in Goleta and threw coffee on them.[16]:87
In a later incident , he splashed his latte on two girls sitting at a bus stop in Isla Vista for not smiling back at him.[16]:100
In July 2012 , Rodger purchased a Super Soaker , filled it with orange juice , and used it to spray a group playing kickball at Girsh Park.[16]:106–107[76 ]
 Referring to an incident that occurred on July 20 , 2013,[76 ] Rodger wrote that " he tried to shove girls at a party over a ten - foot ledge after being mocked but failed " , and instead other boys pushed him over it .
He said that he " felt a snap in [ his ] ankle , followed by a stinging pain " and " tried to get away from there as fast as [ he ] could " .
Realizing that he left his sunglasses at the party , Rodger returned to retrieve them but the " same people he had tangled with before began mocking him and calling him names , then dragged him into the driveway to beat him up " .
One of Rodger 's neighbors said that " he saw Rodger come home , crying " and said that Rodger claimed that he was going to kill the men involved , and " kill myself".[72 ] Rodger told investigating officers that he had been assaulted , but they determined that he might have been the aggressor.[19][76][77 ]
He wrote in his manifesto that the incident was the final trigger for his planning of the attack.[76 ]

On January 15 , 2014 , Rodger accused his roommate Cheng Yuan Hong of stealing his candles ; he performed a citizen 's arrest and called 9 - 1 - 1 .
Hong was charged with petty theft and pleaded guilty to the charge.[78][79 ] Hong was one of Rodger 's stabbing victims.[6 ]

On April 30 , 2014 , about three weeks before the attack,[35 ] Rodger 's parents contacted police after becoming alarmed by his behavior and YouTube videos .
He wrote in his manifesto that he had already planned the killings and purchased his guns by that time .
The officers who interviewed him at his apartment would have found the weapons if they had conducted a search of his bedroom.[16]:134[25][80 ]
Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown later said that the deputies " determined he did not meet the criteria for an involuntary hold " and that Rodger told them " it was a misunderstanding " with his parents.[67 ]
 Manifesto and online posts [ edit ]
 Rodger 's 107,000-word manifesto was titled " My Twisted World : The Story of Elliot Rodger".[81 ] He e - mailed this manifesto to 34 individuals,[9]:7 including his therapist,[2][37 ] his parents , and some of his other family members,[82 ] former schoolteachers , and childhood friends.[83 ]
In the manifesto , Rodger claimed he originally sought to carry out his attack on Halloween of 2013 , but reconsidered because " [ t]here would be too many cops walking around during an event like Halloween , and cops are the only ones who could hinder my plans".[16]:110

In his last YouTube video , titled " Elliot Rodger 's Retribution " , he complained of being rejected by women while envying sexually active men , and described details of his upcoming attack,[36 ] laying out his motives and plans.[33 ]
In the wake of the killings , the video was deleted from Rodger 's account , but copies were repeatedly re - posted by other users.[23][84 ]
In the video , he says :
 Well , this is my last video , it all has to come to this .
Tomorrow is the day of retribution , the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity , against all of you .
For the last eight years of my life , ever since I hit puberty , I 've been forced to endure an existence of loneliness , rejection and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been attracted to me .
Girls gave their affection , and sex and love to other men but never to me.[85 ] I 'm 22 years old and I 'm still a virgin .
I 've never even kissed a girl .
I 've been through college for two and a half years , more than that actually , and I 'm still a virgin .
It has been very torturous .
College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure .
Within those years , I 've had to rot in loneliness .
It 's not fair .
You girls have never been attracted to me .
I do n't know why you girls are n't attracted to me , but I will punish you all for it .
It 's an injustice , a crime , because ... I do n't know what you do n't see in me .
I 'm the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me , the supreme gentleman.[85
]
 He wrote in " My Twisted World " that being of mixed race made him " different from the normal fully white kids".[18][72 ]
On one online forum , he said that he opposed interracial dating and made several racist posts regarding African American , Hispanic , South Asian and East Asian peoples , stating that seeing men of these ethnic groups socializing with white women " makes you want to quit life".[16]:87[72][86 ]
In one online post , Rodger wrote :
 Full Asian men are disgustingly ugly and white girls would never go for you .
You 're just butthurt that you were born as an Asian piece of shit , so you lash out by linking these fake pictures .
You even admit that you wish you were half white .
You 'll never be half - white and you 'll never fulfill your dream of marrying a white woman .
I suggest you jump off a bridge.[86 ]

In his manifesto , Rodger made a racist comment regarding another boy , outlining some of his plans :
 How could an inferior , ugly black boy be able to get a white girl and not me ?
I am beautiful , and I am half white myself .
I am descended from British aristocracy .
He is descended from slaves.[16]:84
On the day before the Day of Retribution , I will start the First Phase of my vengeance : Silently killing as many people as I can around Isla Vista by luring them into my apartment through some form of trickery.[87 ]
 The manifesto specifically mentions a " War on Women " , as the second phase of his plan , for " starving him of sex " , in which he states:[73 ]

The Second Phase will take place on the Day of Retribution itself , just before the climactic massacre .
...
My War on Women .
... I will attack the very girls who represent everything I hate in the female gender : The hottest sorority of UCSB.[88 ]
 Rodger stated in his manifesto that in his self - proclaimed ideal world , he imagined that he would " quarantine all [ women ] in concentration camps .
At these camps , the vast majority of the female population will be deliberately starved to death .
That would be an efficient and fitting way to kill them all off ...
I would have an enormous tower built just for myself ... and gleefully watch them all die."[16]:136
He also said that he planned to kill his half - brother and stepmother , but was n't mentally prepared to kill his father.[80 ]

Reactions and discussion [ edit ]
 Immediate reactions [ edit ]
 California Governor Jerry Brown offered condolences to the families of victims and said that he was " saddened to learn of this senseless tragedy " .
University of California President Janet Napolitano said in a statement while at Laney College , " This is almost the kind of event that 's impossible to prevent and almost impossible to predict."[89 ]

Controversy over video airing [ edit ]

Several news networks , including ABC News , CBS News , NBC News , and MSNBC , limited use of the " Retribution " video posted by Rodger out of fears of copycat crimes .
The Fox News Channel refused to air the video altogether , instead showing five still photographs at the request of the network 's vice president Michael Clemente .
An ABC News spokesman , speaking for network president James Goldston , said , "
James said that unless there is a specific editorial reason to use it , we would err on the side of not using it .
We are going to be very judicious about the use of that video , mindful that its continued use turns it into wallpaper."[90 ]
 Memorial services [ edit ]
 May 27 , 2014 Memorial service for the victims , Harder Stadium , 2014
 Students and community members gathered at Anisq'Oyo ' Park in Isla Vista on the evening of May 24 for a candlelight memorial to remember the victims.[56][91 ]
In addition , the pastor of Isla Vista Church , one of the locations targeted by gunfire during the attacks,[22 ] made church members "
available throughout the weekend for students who would like to receive prayer or need to talk".[92][93 ]

On May 26 , UCSB canceled classes for the following day and scheduled a memorial service for that afternoon .
It also set up counseling services and emergency housing for displaced students.[83 ]
On the following day , more than 20,000 people attended the memorial service at Harder Stadium .
For the memorial , UCSB chancellor Henry T. Yang and executive vice - chancellor Joel Michaelsen said in a written statement , " This is a period of mourning for all of us .
The moving candlelight vigil that our students organized on Saturday evening began the process of healing .
On Tuesday we will remember and honor the victims of this horrible event and come together as an academic community to reflect , talk with each other and think about the future."[94 ]

On May 23 , 2015 , the first anniversary of the attacks , hundreds of people gathered at UCSB for a candlelight vigil commemorating the six slain victims .
The mother of George Chen was scheduled to speak at the event.[95 ]
 Gun control and mental health [ edit ]
 The attacks have renewed calls for gun control and improvements in the U.S. health care system , with Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal saying ,
 " A year and half ago it seemed like we were on the verge of , potentially , legislation that would stop the madness and end the insanity that has killed too many young people , thousands , tens of thousands since Sandy Hook .
I hope , I really , sincerely hope that this tragedy , this unimaginable , unspeakable tragedy , will provide impetus to bring back measures that would keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people who are severely troubled or deranged like this young man was."[96 ]
 Blumenthal also commented regarding the mental health debate ,
 " And I am going to urge that we bring back those bills , maybe reconfigure them to center on mental health , which is a point where we can agree that we need more resources to make the country healthier and to make sure that these kinds of horrific , insane , mad occurrences are stopped .
And the Congress will be complicit if we fail to act."[97 ]

California Senator Dianne Feinstein blamed the National Rifle Association 's " stranglehold " on gun laws for the attack and said " shame on us " in Congress for failing to do something about it.[98 ]
Pennsylvania Congressman Timothy F. Murphy , a clinical psychologist , said his bipartisan mental health overhaul would be a solution and urged Congress to pass it.[99 ]

Richard Martinez , the father of victim Christopher Michaels - Martinez , gave a speech in which he placed the blame of the attacks on " craven , irresponsible " politicians and the National Rifle Association.[96][100 ] Martinez later urged the public to join him in " demanding immediate action " from members of Congress regarding gun control .
He also expressed his sympathy towards Rodger 's parents.[101 ]
 Doris A. Fuller , the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center , said that California law permitted emergency psychiatric evaluations of potentially dangerous individuals through provisions , but such actions were never enabled during the initial police investigation of Rodger .
She said ,
 " Once again , we are grieving over deaths and devastation caused by a young man who was sending up red flags for danger that failed to produce intervention in time to avert tragedy .
In this case , the red flags were so big the killer 's parents had called police ... and yet the system failed."[102 ]
 Some California lawmakers called for an investigation into the deputies ' contact with Rodger on April 30 .
At the time of their visit , he had already bought at least two handguns , which had been entered into the California gun ownership database under his name , as required by California 's universal registration law .
The deputies were unaware of this fact , however , because they did not check the statewide gun ownership database .
They did not view the YouTube videos that had caused Rodger 's parents to contact them .
The sheriff 's office defended the actions of the deputies , as did other state law enforcement agencies .
Some state lawmakers said they planned to introduce legislation that they believe would help prevent future such tragedies.[103 ] On September 30 , 2014 , in the wake of the aforementioned incident , California legislators passed a law to enable a person to ask a judge to have guns seized from a family member who they feel is a danger to themselves or to others .
The gun owner will have an opportunity to contest the seizure .
Gun rights groups , including the National Rifle Association , opposed the legislation , citing that the rights of regular gun owners may be put in jeopardy due to a misunderstanding .
The law went into effect in 2016.[104 ]

Misogyny [ edit ]
 The attack , videos , and written manifesto of Rodger sparked conversations about broader issues of violence against women and misogyny in society.[105][106 ]
Rodger indicated in online postings and YouTube videos that he would punish women for denying him sex and he would also punish men who had access to sex with women , as he did not .
Rodger frequented online forums where he and other men posted misogynistic statements about women.[107 ]
He subscribed to several pick - up artist YouTube channels.[108 ]
For these reasons , as well as Rodger 's apparent sense of entitlement to sex with women , he has been described as misogynistic.[109][110][111][112 ]

Rodger wrote in his manifesto of his plan to invade a sorority house , which he concluded symbolized the world that tortured him , beautiful women who he believed would have rejected him.[21 ]
He wrote , " I will slaughter every single spoiled , stuck - up , blond slut I see inside there .
All those girls I 've desired so much .
They have all rejected me and looked down on me as an inferior man."[113 ] When Rodger was unable to gain access to the sorority house after " vigorous knocking " on the sorority house door , he improvised , opening fire on nearby women students.[21][114 ]

Mary Elizabeth Williams , a staff writer for Salon , objected to the media labeling Rodger as the " virgin killer " , saying that it reinforces gender roles with a " not so subtle insinuation ... that one possible cause of male aggression is a lack of female sexual acquiescence".[115 ] Amanda Hess , writing for Slate , argued that although Rodger killed more men than women , his motivations were misogynistic because his reason for hating the men he attacked was that he thought they stole the women he felt entitled to.[109 ] Writing for Reason , Cathy Young countered with " that seems like a good example of stretching the concept into meaninglessness—or turning it into unfalsifiable quasi - religious dogma " and noted Rodger also wrote many hateful messages about other men.[116 ] National Post columnist Barbara Kay criticized the focus on the female victims and pointed to gendered massacres targeting males , such as in wartime Srebrenica and a school massacre carried out by Boko Haram.[117 ]
 Comments and coverage of misogyny as a root cause have generated criticisms of oversimplification and distortion of the events , which included the killings of more men than women and Rodger 's mental health issues.[118 ] Chris Ferguson , a psychologist writing in Time , argued that laying the blame on misogynistic culture glosses over how Rodger was one particular mentally disturbed man ( see above).[119 ] Some writers used the # NotAllMen hashtag on Twitter to express the fact that not all men are misogynistic and not all men commit murder .
Others criticized use of this hashtag , as it was considered to derail from discussion of the issue of violence against women.[107][121 ] Someone created the Twitter hashtag # YesAllWomen on May 24 to express that all women experience misogyny and sexism , although not all men are sexist.[122][123 ]
 Congress [ edit ]
 The United States House of Representatives voted on June 10 , 2014 , to pass House Resolution 608 , entitled Condemning the senseless rampage and mass shooting that took place in Isla Vista , California , on Friday May 23 , 2014.[124][125 ] Rep. Lois Capps ( D - CA ) said that Congress needed to take more action to stop gun violence , saying , " We must not let the drumbeat fall silent .
Congress has the power to act and we must . "
Rep. Jackie Speier ( D - CA ) agreed with her , saying that " Americans , outraged by our inability to get anything done on the issue , are waiting for us to come to our senses and to act."[124 ]
