School remembers teen who died from gunshot Posted : Tuesday , January 20 , 2015 10:49 AM EST Updated : Tuesday , January 20 , 2015 3:13 PM EST
 A boy is dead from what appears to be an accidental discharge from a rifle last weekend , near Baconton .

Jackson O ' Quinn died Sunday , and classmates at Baconton Charter School wore camouflage Tuesday in his honor .

Mitchell County investigators tell WALB News that two 13 year old boys went hunting in Randolph County with one of the boy 's grandfather , and they were dropped off at a parent 's house afterward .

The boys were told to put the guns up , and they would clean them later .

Investigators say the grandfather went home while the dad was outside doing some work in the yard , and shortly after , the father heard a gun shot from inside the house .

The 13 year old was shot through the chest , near the heart , and died before the ambulance arrived .

The case is still under investigation , and right now , remains a tragic accident .
No charges have been filed .

More information from WALB later today .
