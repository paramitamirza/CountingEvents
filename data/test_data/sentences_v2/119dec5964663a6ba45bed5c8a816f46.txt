1 Dead , 3 Injured After Fairywood Shooting
PITTSBURGH ( KDKA/AP ) – Authorities in western Pennsylvania say four men playing dice in a Pittsburgh neighborhood were shot and one was killed overnight .

It happened Saturday night around 10 p.m. on West Prospect Avenue in the Fairywood section of the city .

Public safety spokeswoman
Sonya Police say they first responded to a call that a man had been shot in the head .

Toler said the victims were outside playing dice when a gold minivan and a silver car drove down the street heading north .

“ We went down the way and noticed there was a young man laying on the ground , face - down , two young other fellows running up the street trying to get away , ” said neighbor Darryl Faulkner .

The Allegheny County medical examiner ’s office said 19-year - old Kason Barnes was hit in the head and shoulder and died at the scene .

From my understanding , the person stood so many yards away and shot him three times maliciously , got out of the vehicle , ” said Barnes’ mother Rhonda .

Rhonda Barnes says she doesn’t understand why it happened .

I’m troubled that they feel like they have to do something like this to another individual , ” she said .
And it ’s sad , it ’s sad .
And if anybody does know anything , I’d really hope they’d man up and say what they know .
It ’s not like you’re snitching — he was a victim and he was a good guy .
”

The other three men , who ranged in age from 20 to 22 , were listed in stable condition .

No word on a suspect or motive .

Anyone with information is asked to call 911 .
