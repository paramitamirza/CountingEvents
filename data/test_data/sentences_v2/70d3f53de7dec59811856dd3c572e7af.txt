Eviction shooting case : Did county notify police of mental health issues ?
Don Meyer
 HARRISBURG , Pa. ( WHTM ) –
When someone is involuntarily committed for mental health issues , the facility where they are committed must notify the county .
The county is then required to notify state police so they can put the information into their background check system , preventing that person from purchasing firearms .

That did not happen with Don Meyer Jr. , the man charged in the death of his 12-year - old daughter Ciara , ABC27 News has learned .

Meyer allegedly pointed a rifle at a constable serving an eviction notice at the family ’s home near Duncannon last month .
The constable fired one shot that went through Meyer ’s arm and into Ciara ’s chest , killing her .
Police said Meyer should not have owned guns because he was involuntarily committed to a mental health institution .

ABC27 News obtained a gun application Meyer filled out in 2012 , the year after he had been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility in Dauphin County .
Last week , we asked state police why the application was not flagged .
They said they were never notified by the county that Meyer was involuntarily committed .

ABC27 filed a right - to - know request with Dauphin County , asking for any documents that would show the county had notified state police about Meyer ’s involuntary commitment in 2011 .
In an email , the county open records officer said the county is prohibited by law from commenting on specific mental health - related cases .

Following the media reports of this incident , the county conducted a quality assurance review and determined that all proper procedures were followed , ” said Scott Burford , Dauphin County ’s open records officer .

We showed this response to Pennsylvania State Police .

“ We have no record of having received a notification , either in our database or paper archives of this particular Act 77 notification form , ” said Trooper Adam Reed , a state police spokesman .

The gun Meyer purchased in 2012 was not recovered when police conducted a search warrant at this home after his daughter ’s death , but they did recover five other weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition .
Four years after he had been committed , Meyer still had weapons .

Michael Giaramita , a Harrisburg - based attorney who deals with gun laws , says under the law Meyer should not have had any weapons in his home .

Under Pennsylvania law , those who have been committed under the Mental Health Procedures Act have 60 days to get rid of those firearms , ”
Giaramita said .

In this case , State Police say they did not know Meyer had been committed , but if they had , would they have been required to go to his home and remove any guns ?

I am unaware of any law that requires them to go to the person and remove the firearms from the home , ” Giaramita said .

An issue that can be added to the mental health/gun debate .

There is a need to enforce the existing laws , and until they begin enforcing the existing laws , we are wasting our time searching for a broader solution , ”
Giaramita said .

In 2011 , involuntary mental health commitment notifications were done by fax or mail .
Dauphin County is now using an online option that allows them to enter the information directly into the State Police database .
