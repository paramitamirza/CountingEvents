Police : 2 dead , 2 injured in West Palm Beach shooting
West Palm Beach Police are investigating a quadruple shooting that happened in the 800 block of 19th Street .

It 's the site where a double shooting happened a little over a month ago .

Police responded a little after 1:45 p.m. Thursday to find four men were shot .

One was pronounced dead on scene , a second was transported to the hospital as a trauma patient .
He later died at the hospital .
Police say he was a juvenile .

Two others were also transported to the hospital with non - life - threatening injuries .

Police are not identifying the victims but a resident in the area , Ricky Aiken , who just recently founded the Inner City Innovators program , says the man who died on scene was his 18-year - old friend .

He says the four men were walking down the road when a car pulled up , whipped out a weapon that looked like an assault rifle , and fired several rounds .

" People are doing the best they can , " he said .
" You know , people are here for a reason .
If everyone could get up and leave to a safer environment they would , but they ca n't .
This is life for us .
This is life for them . "

Aiken is urging the community to come together and use this as fuel for change .

Police say they do not have a suspect in custody at this time and they are still working to find a motive .
