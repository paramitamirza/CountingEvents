" It 's 3 o'clock in the afternoon .
Kids are getting out of school , people are getting off of work , we have the MVA in the shopping center along with many other businesses , so whoever did it is a reckless individual who is capable of doing something like this again , and we need to get that person identified and off the streets as soon as possible , " Baltimore police Director T.J. Smith said .

A witness , Willie Johnson , described what he saw : " Just firing , firing of the guns and stuff , and then after that , everybody started running . "

Life does n't mean anything anymore , and it 's like , here today , gone tomorrow .
They do n't think about their family .
They do n't think about the family of the people they 're hurting .
It just makes me terrified for my children , " said Ryekiesha Paul , who was at the shopping center .
