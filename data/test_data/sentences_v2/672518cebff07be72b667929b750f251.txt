 NASHVILLE , Tenn. ( WKRN ) —
After a traumatic several days , five year old Caleb Young told News Channel 11 ’s sister station News 2 that he can’t wait to eat his favorite treat when he gets home from the hospital .
 “ Donuts ! ”
exclaimed Young , referring to the treat he will enjoy after he is released from the hospital Monday .

Last Tuesday , Caleb was out in the yard with his 10-year - old brother shooting birds with a BB gun when he stepped in front of his brother as he fired a shot .

“ Complete fear came over me and I started praying instantly for my son that the Lord would watch over him , ” said Kevin Young , Caleb ’s father .

Emergency responders flew Caleb to Vanderbilt Children ’s Hospital where he had open heart surgery .

Surgeons told Caleb ’s family they had never seen anything like it .
A small BB traveled through the left side of Caleb ’s heart , down a vein , and almost reached his liver .

“ They put a stitch on his heart to close up the wound that was there .
Then they x - rayed and they noticed that the BB was down in the lower abdomen , ” said Kevin Young .

Caleb had a second major surgery to remove the BB.

The 5-year - old ’s recovery will be difficult but doctors said it ’s amazing he ’s alive today .

“ I am truly thankful because it truly is a miracle that he is still here because I put on my Facebook that I could have easily been standing by a grave , instead of next to a miracle , ” said Kevin Young .

Kevin Young said he has been overwhelmed by the thoughtful messages the family has received from across the nation .

Doctors said Caleb ’s recovery will be a long process , but he should be well enough to start kindergarten in the fall .
