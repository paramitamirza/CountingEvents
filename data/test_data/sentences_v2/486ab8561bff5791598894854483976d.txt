His mother , a young sibling and friends of an older sibling were at the home in the 1200 block of Holden at the time .
The child ’s mother and others in the residence were taken to sheriff ’s office headquarters for interviews .

It appears someone might have been playing with a gun , ”
Rollins said .

A neighbor , Teaethel Jones , said she was sitting in her car getting ready to leave when she saw the child ’s mother come out in the street screaming .
Another neighbor ran to help her .

She said , ‘
They done killed my baby,’ ”
Jones said of the mother ’s words , adding , “
She said ‘
They.’ ”
 While the other neighbor ran into the house to see what happened , Jones stayed in the street .
Jones said the neighbor who went in the home collapsed when she walked outside and said the child was bleeding from the head and mouth .

Jones said the family was new to the neighborhood .
She often saw the mother on the street pushing her two young children in a stroller .
She said she thinks the mother has a teenage son who lives in the home as well .
 “
She ’s a good mom , ” Jones said .
She has both of those babies with her at all times . ”
