 INDIANAPOLIS , Ind. – An Indianapolis mother who was arrested in the case of a 2-year - old boy who died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound made her first court appearance Thursday .

Kanisha Shelton , 23 , was charged with neglect of a dependent resulting in death after police say her son found a gun in her purse and fatally shot himself last month .

In court Thursday , she was given five weeks to find an attorney .
Her next hearing is scheduled for June 16 with a trial set for July .
A dozen supporters surrounded her as she entered the building Thursday , many of them wearing shirts saying , " his wings were ready , but my heart was not . "

The shooting occurred on April 20 just after 9 p.m. in the 5200 block of Alameda Road on Indy 's northwest side .
When officers arrived on scene , they say they found the unresponsive 2-year - old boy suffering from a single gunshot wound to the chest .
The child was rushed to Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health where he was later pronounced dead by medical staff .

Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said it was not an emotionally easy decision to charge Shelton , but that the law made it necessary .
It took about three weeks to file charges because prosecutors had to interview Shelton and her family members .
 "
We’re not unsympathetic that this is a horrible , horrible tragedy for the mother .
...
The law is clear that if you put your child in these dangerous circumstances then it can constitute a crime , " Curry said .

According to court documents , Shelton told police that the shooting occurred while she was upstairs putting her 9-month - old daughter to bed .

Shelton told police that her purse was on the kitchen counter , and sometimes her son climbs on the chairs that are against the counter .
Shelton also told police that her son “ gets into her purse all of the time , ” according to court documents .

Shelton had a permit for the gun .
She told detectives that at a local gun store , " she was instructed to keep the gun loaded , with a bullet in the chamber " and that she " keeps the gun in her car , but recently decided she should have it in the home with her . "

Local firearms experts say it is never the right thing to keep a loaded gun in reach of your children , and that instead you should use a gun lock or an easy - to - open safe that your kids ca n't access .

" If you think it ’s out of reach , ( they 'll ) prove you wrong so you always want to have it locked up and hidden , " Zach Rogers with Indy Arms Co said .

Curry said that no matter how many cases like this happen , they still continue to go on .
His office is working a nearly identical case from 2013 , in which a three - year - old boy also got a gun from the kitchen counter .
His father , Nicholas Gulling , has agreed to a plea agreement .

" ( We ) start to sound like a broken record because we’ve had these situations arise and they continue to arise .
We would hope that at some point all parents would realize that if you’re going to be a gun owner , you’ve got to be a responsible gun owner , " Curry said .
