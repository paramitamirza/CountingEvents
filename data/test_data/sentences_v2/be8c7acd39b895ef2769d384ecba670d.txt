Emergency crews were called out to the Southern Meadows trailer park near Southern and 41st avenues just after 10:30 p.m.
 " Eight people were in front of the trailer park , " Sheriff Joe Arpaio said at a news briefing .
"
Two adults were killed by a suspect or suspects that walked by and shot a semi - automatic weapon at the group of people . "

The man and woman were identified on Tuesday evening .

" We need help from the public to solve this attack , " Arpaio said .

People with any information are asked to call the sheriff 's office at 602 - 876 - 1011 .

" It was difficult for neighbors to pick up on what happened because fireworks were going off .
We need help to solve this vicious incident . ” Arpaio said .

A 13-year - old and a 15-year - old were shot in the leg .
Another juvenile was also wounded .
The teens are expected to be OK.

The teens ' father said they told him it was gang - related , but that has not been confirmed by police .

“ I saw a baby being pulled out and they ran it to the ambulance , all full of blood , " the man said .
"
And then I saw a big , heavy - set guy rolled out at the same time .
He was full of blood . ”

Another person was having trouble breathing and complained of chest pain and was taken to the hospital , too .

Police do not have any suspect descriptions but are looking for an older model white Lexus .
