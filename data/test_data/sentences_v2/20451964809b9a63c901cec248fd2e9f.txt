Six - month - old Miracle Murray was slain today during a shooting on Detroit 's west side .

Hours after the bullets flew , two men were taken into custody in connection with the crime , police said .

Police said they believe the shooting is connected to the fatal shooting of 3-year - old Aniaya Montgomery in Detroit on Easter Sunday that resulted in the indictment of three men by a one - man grand jury in Wayne County Circuit Court .

Detroit police spokesman Sgt .
Michael Woody said one of the suspects in Miracle 's shooting today had initially been investigated in the Easter shooting , but was eliminated as a suspect .
Woody said " there is a gang nexus involved " in today 's shooting .

Miracle was killed when shots were fired at a house on Winthrop near Clarita on Detroit 's west side about 1:30 p.m. , police said .
A 24-year - old man was also struck and was in serious condition .
Witnesses said he was shot in the hip and leg .
His relationship to the baby is unclear , Officer Dan Donakowski said .

In addition to the two suspects in custody , police said there might be a third unidentified suspect .

Tia Murray , who said she is a relative to the baby and saw the shooting , said people were in the front yard when she heard gunfire .

" I was coming around the corner , I heard the gunshots up and down the street , " said Murray , who said she drove the baby to the hospital , but it was too late .

" I ran all kinds of red lights , " she said .

Murray said the baby was named Miracle because her mother had complications during pregnancy .

" She made it to six months , that 's a miracle to me , " Murray said .

Kyra Street , who said she is Miracle 's 21-year - old sister , said she was in the yard with her two young children and felt a bullet whiz by her face .

" I looked right back at him when he was shooting , " Street said .
" I 'm real lucky . "
