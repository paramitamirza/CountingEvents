By about 10 p.m. , both shootings were being investigated as homicides .

The North Circle shooting happened in an alleyway , though as of Thursday night , no information on circumstances were available .
A suspect was not in custody .

The second shooting happened near the park ’s basketball courts , just east of the West Las Vegas Library .
At least one person was shot in the chest , and that person was taken to University Medical Center ’s trauma unit , where he later died .

Police said he was a young black male but could not confirm his age .

After the second shooting , officers worked to clear the park of bystanders .
Witnesses were separated and interviewed by the basketball bleachers as detective marked spots in the parking lot where shell casings were found .

As of Thursday night , police did not know what may have led to the shooting ; detectives were still interviewing witnesses .

About 10:45 p.m. at the park , three women walked up to the police tape near the basketball courts , pleading to be let in .
They knew the person shot and their relative was at the park when it happened , they told police .

As officers worked to get them united with their relative , who was talking to officers , one woman in the group got a call , then answered her phone .

Seconds later , she said , “
He ’s dead . ”

One of the women with her immediately broke down .
Another puffed her cigarette , her hand shaking .
The woman who answered the call cried out , “
That boy stayed at my house !
That boy stayed at my house ! ”

An officer on scene nodded his head , lifted the police tape and let them in .

The coroner ’s office will name both people killed once their families have been notified .
