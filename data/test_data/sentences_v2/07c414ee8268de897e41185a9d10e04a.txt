A 46-year - old man in Davidson County , North Carolina was shot in the neck on Thursday when his 3-year - old grandson found and fired an unsecured weapon .

Davidson County Sheriff ’s Department officials told WXII Channel 12 that they received a 911 call just after 7 p.m. Thursday reporting that Nicholas Cardillo , 46 , had been shot by his toddler grandson .

Paramedics transported Cardillo to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center , where his injury was treated and found to be non - life - threatening .

Cardillo told police that he was in the shower when he heard a noise and emerged to find the boy holding a .380-caliber pistol .
He reportedly told the boy to set the weapon down , but it went off .

Police are investigating the incident .
Cardillo said that he had set the gun down when he took off his clothes to shower .
He removed the magazine from the pistol , but neglected to clear the bullet in the firing chamber .

According to Bloomberg News , the Center for American Progress and the CDC , Americans are now more likely to die from gunshot injuries than in auto accidents .

As cars and driving become safer and safer , the NRA and other pro - gun groups are obstructing any new restrictions on firearms ownership or requirements for safety devices that would make guns less dangerous .
As a result , the number of deaths in road accidents continues to steadily decline as the number of gun fatalities inches upward .
