A 9-year - old boy was recovering Friday morning after police say he found a gun in his parents ' South Philadelphia home and accidentally shot himself .

Police were called to the house on 32nd Street near Dickinson , in the Grays Ferry neighborhood , just before 10 p.m. , Chief Inspector Scott Small said .
When they arrived , officers learned from family members that the boy found a gun in a front bedroom and accidentally shot himself in the left hand .
His mother and other relatives had already taken him to Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .

Police met the boy and his mother at Children 's Hospital , Small said , and found that the boy was suffering a gunshot wound to his left ring finger .

Small said that a preliminary investigation indicated that the loaded gun had been hidden behind a bed in the front bedroom of the house .
The boy found it and was playing with it when it accidentally discharged , wounding him .
He said police found blood on the bed near the gun and a bullet hole in the bedroom wall .
No one else was injured in the shooting .

The boy was expected to be OK.
 "
This could 've been a lot worse , " Small said .
" We 're very fortunate . "

Small said the boy 's accidental shooting should serve as a lesson to adults to store guns safely where children ca n't access them .

" The fact that a 9-year - old boy was able to get hold of a loaded semiautomatic weapon just goes to show that there was n't safety used at this house to keep the weapon out of the reach of the child , " the chief said .
" If anything , have the bullets and the weapon separate . "

Small said detectives were interviewing the boy 's parents and other relatives who were in the house at the time .
It was unclear whether any criminal charges would be filed .
