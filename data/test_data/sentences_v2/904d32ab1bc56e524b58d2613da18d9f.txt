 HAZELWOOD , Mo. ( KMOV.com ) â€“
A fourth man is facing charges in connection to a deadly shooting that took place along Interstate 270 in Hazelwood Sunday , February 21 .

John Howard Stith , 20 , joins Tony Bailey , 21 , Jerrod Corley , 24 , and Leroy Coleman , 20 , who were arrested and charged Friday , five days after Emma Wallace , 37 , was shot and killed near North Lindbergh Boulevard .
They face charges of first - degree murder , unlawful use of a weapon and multiple counts of assault and armed criminal action .

Wallace was inside a vehicle with three other people when the drive - by shooting happened around 2 a.m. Sunday .
She had just been with friends at Jay 's Classic Bar and on north Lindbergh before the shooting .

Police believe the shooting stemmed from a long running personal dispute .

"
A confrontation , a disagreement .
Something that was spurred from an event that happened between two people within the last year , " said Hazelwood Police Chief Greg Hall .

Two other victims , a man and woman , were listed in serious condition , and another man was released from the hospital after the shooting .

Authorities believe Coleman carjacked a woman and three children on the Schnucks parking lot in Central West End only a few days before the shooting .
