CBS 58 - Five Killed in Overnight Shootings in Milwaukee
MILWAUKEE - Five men are dead after a series of overnight shooting 's in Milwaukee .

" We had a horrible night last night , " Mayor Tom Barrett said Saturday afternoon .

The shooting 's stretched from 6 p.m. Friday to 3 a.m. Saturday , a 9-hour span that saw 9 shootings , including the 5 deaths .

The victims range in age from 21 to 36 .

According to police , the first shooting happened around 6 p.m. on Sherman Blvd .
That 's when a 33-year - old man was shot while driving near Sherman Park .

"
The police were right there , " said Barrett .
" They were in Sherman Park , they could hear the gunshots . "

Seven hours later , police say a " robbery - related incident " led to a shooting near 23rd and State .
A 21-year - old male , and a 23-year - old male were killed in that shooting .

Then , just before 3 a.m. , a group began arguing in the parking lot of the All Stars Bar off 40th and Fond du Lac Ave .
Police say four people were shot .
A 36-year - old male , and a 34-year - old male were killed .

Desmond Barnes goes to church across the street .

" It 's very sad , very sickening , " he says .
" So much violence going on , and it 's senseless violence . "

According to police , there have now been 81 homicides in Milwaukee this year .
At this point last year , there were 94 .

" It happens way too often , " said Mayor Barrett .
" It happens because there are too many guns .
It happens because there are too many people that do n't know how to solve their problems without violence . "

But community leaders like Tory Lowe say access to guns is only part of the problem .

" It 's way deeper than the gun issue , because most of the people that carry guns , they carry them for an economic reason .
They want to get paid , they want to strong - arm somebody , it 's economic .
There are only two ways to reduce violence in any community .
That 's jobs , create an industry for people to work , and better education . "
