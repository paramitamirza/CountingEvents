 FELTON , Minn. -- A Felton , Minn. , man is accused of shooting his 22-month - old daughter in the leg after handling his gun in dim lighting after drinking 12 beers .

Fernando Rocha , 24 , was charged Thursday in Clay County District Court with one count of child endangerment , a felony .

Clay County deputies received a report Friday that a 22-month - old was being treated at Sanford Medical Center in Fargo for a gunshot wound , court documents state .

At the hospital , Rocha told detectives he 'd been sitting on the floor near the bed cleaning his handgun by the light of a portable lamp at about 4:30 a.m. when it went off as he was putting it away , hitting the child who was asleep in the bed with his wife .

He admitted to drinking about 12 beers in the course of the evening , court documents allege .

The toddler was hit through the right thigh by the bullet from the 45-caliber gun , a trajectory which did n't square with the angle at which Rocha told them he 'd been sitting at the time of the shooting , investigators found .

Another witness confirmed to investigators that the lights in the home were off because the power had been turned off to that address sometime earlier .

Three days later , in another law enforcement interview , Rocha allegedly admitted he 'd been sitting on the bed and playing with the gun when it went off and hit his daughter .

He told detectives he would not have been impaired by the alcohol he 'd consumed , court documents say .
