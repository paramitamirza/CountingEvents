 Police were called around 8:30 p.m. to a location near Greenmount Avenue and Preston Street .

Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said investigators believe the shooting was an act of retaliation to a Labor Day weekend triple shooting that injured two women , one pregnant , and killed a man .
In the Labor Day shooting , police arrested Marion Daughton , who investigators said is a known gang member .

Davis said one of the shooters came from an alley and two others came from up the street , shooting at a group of people .

" They emerged from three different directions , they planned it , it was premeditated , " Davis said .
" One came from an alley two came from up the street and they shot at a group of people that were standing just over my left shoulder . "

" That 's premeditated .
Those are the people who not only need to be in jail but underneath the jail , and we need to do the best we can to identify them , " Davis said .

Police said the victims -- six men ranging in age from 26 to 39 , a 36-year - old woman and a toddler -- are expected to survive their injuries .
Among the victims is a 3-year - old girl and her father who were near the group of people .

T.J. Smith , chief of media relations for the Baltimore Police Department , said at least a dozen shots were fired .

" This was an intended shooting at victims .
The 3-year - old and the father were in a different location from the group , but these guys who committed this act really did n't care and they shot a 3-year - old girl , " Smith said .
" These people wanted to be killers tonight but were n't successful in that . "

Police believe three suspects are responsible for the shootings , one person armed with a shotgun and two people armed with handguns .
Police believe the intended targets know who attempted to kill them .

" We have gotten anonymous tips in and we 're very appreciative of that and we 're hopeful that we 'll get additional tips in , " Smith said .
