Luke lived at the house on Amesti Road with his father and uncle , both of whom were stabbed just before 3 a.m. Saturday .

LIVE OAK >
> The frantic 15-year - old stabbing suspect , who gripped a 4-inch pocket knife while under the influence of LSD , was fighting off a K-9 officer and nonlethal rounds when a deputy fired an AR-15 , a rifle , at Luke Smith ’s chest Saturday morning in Corralitos .

Luke died about 3:15 a.m. at the 300 block of Pioneer Road , about a quarter - mile from his part - time home at the end of Amesti Road where authorities said he stabbed his father and uncle multiple times and fled , according to Santa Cruz County Sheriff ’s Office .
 “
Luke Smith was a great kid , ”
Sheriff Jim Hart said during the second press conference in two days in response to the shooting .
Smith attended Aptos High School .
He was well - liked by everyone and his actions Saturday morning were out of character for him .
Luke and a friend bought and used LSD on Friday night , Hart said .

There ’s no motive for the attacks at this time , ” Hart said .
And we believe that Luke was acting out due to the adverse reaction to the LSD. ”

What unfolded early Saturday morning started just before 3 a.m. when Luke ’s father and uncle called 911 to report that Luke had stabbed them .

When law enforcement arrived , Luke was near the scene , talking to officers , and at some point climbed on top of a fire truck and banged on the windows .
He fled shortly thereafter with 11 officers from three agencies giving chase .

They followed Smith along Pioneer Road about 13 minutes .
At one point , an officer ’s body camera footage shows him running into the yard of a home on Pioneer Road .
Officers tell Luke repeatedly to drop the knife .
They also ask Luke what he needs .

At a press conference Monday , Hart released multiple pieces of body camera footage from the shooting , saying it was in the interest of transparency though he noted that Smith ’s family was not comfortable with the footage being released .

The footage shows 13 minutes of negotiation with Smith as well as the use of Tasers , weighted foam rounds and a K-9 .
At least one of the three Taser shots struck Luke , but did not stop him .
One of the foam rounds hit Luke in the hand holding the knife but failed to cause him to drop the weapon .
And Capitola officer Pedro Zamora deployed his K-9 partner Kato twice .
Despite Kato ’s grip on Luke ’s arm , he appeared as though he felt no pain .

None of their nonlethal efforts worked , Hart said , causing nine - year veteran officer Chris Vigil to fire the fatal round from an AR-15 , which is an assault rifle .
The bullet hit Luke in the chest .

 “
The boy raised the knife again before he was shot in the chest , ” Hart said .

Vigil fired the fatal round at Luke , who was spinning as he was being attacked by the K-9 and at some point fell to the ground either as he was shot or before , the video shows .
Hart said hitting Luke in the chest was the only option .

Luke died at the scene .

What I see in that video is the dog goes for the right hand , which is the knife hand and then he shakes off the dog of his right hand and the dog re - engages with the left hand , ” Hart said .
He brings the left hand and makes a stabbing motion toward the dog and then lunges toward the dog handler .
Hart said , “
It ’s an angle that ’s really hard to see that .
If you break it down , I think you’ll see that . ”

The thing that ’s important to know is what ’s on that video and what I’ve just described is all consistent with the officers’ statements that were all taken independently , ” Hart said .

Hart said Vigil has been with the Sheriff ’s Office for nine years and has at least 100 hours of conflict resolution training .
He is on administrative leave .
The other four deputies and a sergeant from the Sheriff ’s Office are on their regularly scheduled days off .
Three Watsonville police officers and two Capitola officers also responded .

Of the fatal shooting , Hart said Vigil “ did not do anything wrong .
Hart said Saturday night that deputies arrested four people believed to have sold the drugs to Luke and one of his friends .
They are Taylor Filson , 28 , a leasing consultant from Santa Cruz ; Bradley Hodge , 24 , a business owner from Santa Cruz ; Thomas Negron , 20 , who lists no occupation but is from Santa Cruz , and Nathaniel Trecaso , 28 .

Filson , Hodge and Negron were arrested on Pacific Avenue after 11 p.m. Saturday on suspicion of manufacturing a controlled substance , a felony .

All three remained at Santa Cruz County Jail on Monday night .
Filson also is accused of transporting and selling narcotics or controlled substances , also felonies .
She is being held in lieu of $ 50,000 bail .
Hodge is in custody in lieu of $ 60,000 bail .
Negron remained at jail in lieu of $ 50,000 bail .
There were no online jail records for Trecaso .

The family
 Friends have launched a GoFundMe campaign for Luke ’s family , which includes a sister , who is a senior at Aptos High , his mother , a flight attendant , and his father , a construction worker .
The GoFundMe campaign donations will be given to his mother , a Vietnamese immigrant who came to the United States as a teenager .
The fund has raised nearly $ 5,000 .

Luke ’s father and uncle work at Knox Roofing .
A woman who answered the phone at the roofing business on Monday said the stabbings have left workers reeling from the news .

We’ve all been praying , ” she said .
“ We’ve all been crying .
It ’s been horrible .
We even had a few workers who didn’t come in today .
An Aptos woman , who declined to be named but said she and her sons and husband considered Luke to be a part of their family , said Monday , “
The family is just torn up and it ’s just so sad .

He was genuinely a great kid , brilliant , with an encyclopedic memory , ” she said .

The story about him needs to be clear .
This is a great kid with huge potential who will never see it ... and that ’s not all right .
She said Luke chose to live with his father even though he’d told his friends that there was abuse in the household .
She wondered if the stabbing resulted from self - defense and said she was upset about how Luke was being portrayed .
 “
What tore me up is that he ’s being written about like he ’s a perpetrator .
He ’s not an aggressor .
He ’s a gentle , kind soul .
Joar Opheim , founder and CEO of Nordic Naturals in Watsonville and whose children were friends of Luke , told the Sentinel in an email that “
Luke was brilliant , a straight A student while taking several college classes ... ”

Opheim wrote , “ Luke was a highly talented boy , who was taking care of himself as best as he could , who was given acid this particular night , and then flipped ... ”

Opheim , who said 15 of Luke ’s friends gathered at his house Saturday and Sunday , said , “ We can never get Luke back .
”
 Luke ’s sister posted this on her Facebook page about the drug her brother took : “
There is a bad batch of LSD circulating throughout the area ... On Saturday morning at 3AM , this batch of LSD made my brother extremely violent and ended with the police shooting him .
Nothing could stop him from what he was doing , because he wasn’t himself ; this drug brought out some form of evil in him .

I have seen my brother on almost every drug he has done , and not once was there a hint of violence or aggression in his character .
Luke Smith was , and still is , the funniest , happiest , most loved kid in the county .
He brought a smile to everyone ’s face and emitted nothing but good vibes .
He could befriend anyone , which he often did , and would never dream of hurting anyone the way he did the night that this LSD , or whatever it was , took over him .
There are hundreds of close friends and strangers who could testify to the nature of this remarkable young man .
Intelligent , talented , passionate .
The Aptos mom said she knew both Luke ’s mother and father .

Luke split his time with his mother , who lives in Aptos , and his sister , staying with his sister when his mother was out of town working , and living with his father in Corralitos .

The Aptos mother said while she had not witnessed Luke ’s drug problem , she knew he had been in rehab .

Yet she said , the kind of behavior that has been reported is far from what she witnessed when Luke spent time with her family , eating dinner with them , occasionally staying overnight and getting rides to school .
He even went on family vacations with them .

She struggles to explain the situation to her children and their friends .
After the incident , 15 of Luke ’s friends gathered to try to understand what happened .
They even tried to attend the Saturday press conference to learn more details .

Her biggest question lies in what happened in the early morning hours Saturday that led law enforcement to what they called a “ tragic ” situation that led to Luke ’s death .

What was their rush ?
Why were they in such a hurry at 3 in the morning .
They didn’t have time to talk him down ?
” she asked .
He must have been terrified , chasing him with dogs , possibly a victim of abuse .
Who isn’t going to run from police officers with guns ?

While she struggles to help her sons and Luke ’s friends cope with the situation , the Aptos mother and Opheim said they want to organize to stop this from happening again .

Opheim wrote , “
There needs to be a change !
When it is OK to shoot a boy with no gun and police officers and police dogs all over the place ?
This was not the time .

We will do all we can to get justice . ”

School support
 Aptos High put out an email and phone message to the families , offering grief support and counselors .
