A Monroe man was charged second - degree murder and possession of a firearm of a convicted felon following a Sunday morning shooting at the Monroe Civic Center that left two dead and three wounded .

On Monday , Monroe Police Chief Quentin Holmes announced that Jaterrious " Dra " Godfrey , 24 , of 1005 Girod St. , Monroe , was arrested following an investigation .
Holmes said an arrest warrant was obtained for Godfrey on a count of second - degree murder and a count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon after witnesses identified him as one of the shooters in the Sunday morning event .

Godfrey was arrested around 1 a.m. Monday and booked into Ouachita Correctional Center with a bond of $ 650,000 .

Holmes previously said officers were dispatched to the Civic Center parking lot shortly after 1:30 a.m. Sunday regarding a fight that had broken out as patrons were leaving a private event attended by as many as 2,000 people .

An initial investigation suggested that two groups with a previously existing conflict stated fighting in the parking lot after the event .
As officers were responding , gunshots were fired , and five people were hit .

Two victims died , and three were hospitalized with non - life - threatening injuries .
The names of the deceased are being withheld pending notification of next - of - kin .

The party was a BYOB event , according to reports , but Holmes said further investigation , including autopsy reports , would be required to determine if the victims had consumed alcohol before the shooting .

Holmes said an update on this case will be provided Tuesday .
