Last updated at 10:39 a.m. on Sunday , Nov. 27
 Fairbanks police are investigating an incident at a local hotel that left four people dead as a murder and suicide .

According to a release from the Fairbanks Police Department ( FPD ) , officers and the Fairbanks Fire Department responded to the Hampton Inn at 433 Harold Bentley Ave .
after hotel staff called about a “ suspicious circumstance .
”
 When officers arrived at the scene , they found a man sitting in the hallway crying .
Police say he directed them to a nearby hotel room where officers found the four people — three adults and a child — dead of apparent gunshot wounds .
Police said in a statement the shooting appears to have occurred shortly before officers arrived .

Police spokesman Doug Wellborn said a single firearm was found inside the hotel room .

Friday night , police released the names of the deceased :
 54-year - old Linda Hutton
 22-year - old Emily McDonald
 22-year - old McKay Hutton
 8-week - old Teagan Hutton
 “
Preliminary investigation shows McKay shot the other three victims and then committed suicide , ” Wellborn wrote .

Wellborn stated that the man crying in the hallway is a family member of at least one of the victims , and is not considered a suspect in the investigation .
He said police do not believe he was present for the shooting .

Yumi McCulloch , a spokeswoman for FPD , said the victims were related to one another — Linda Hutton was McKay Hutton ’s mother , and McDonald and McKay Hutton were married and were both parents to Teagan .

Mason Jefferies calls himself a school buddy to McKay Hutton , whom he described as a family man .
He said McKay Hutton took in McDonald ’s son from a previous relationship and treated him as his own son .
McKay Hutton posted on the Facebook group Fairbanks “ ROCKS ” ! , showing off some of the family ’s adventures at local parks .
 “
He ’s an overall great person , and he ’s a lovable man , ”
Jefferies said in a phone interview .
A little rowdy at times , but he ’s a very fun person , and lovable .
Jefferies said McDonald was kindhearted like her husband , and he was surprised when he learned of their deaths .

They loved each other , they loved their country , and I don’t see a reason why they would have any complications in their relationship , but everybody has things that go on in their life that people don’t understand , so people are quick to judge , and they should take a sec to realize this tragic situation and give prayers for that , ” he said .

McDonald ’s mother , Linda Hendrick , recently moved away from Anchorage to New Mexico , but said since hearing the news , she has made plans to return .

When I was called and notified that my daughter and grand daughter were murdered , I fell to my knees and cried like never before , ” she said .
This news has destroyed me .
No one deserves this !
Emily was a wonderful person , and an amazing mother .
Hendrick said McDonald was exploring the idea of becoming a registered nurse , having acquired her CNA license .
She was working at Lilley Lodge LLC , an assisted - living home , and was on maternity leave when she died , her boss Terryann Gainer confirmed .

Police said there was no indication that drugs or alcohol were involved in the deaths , and they were still investigating the motive behind the crime .

There have been questions regarding another child .
That child ’s identity is not being released at this time but he was not present during this incident and is safe , ” Wellborn said .
Relationship between this child and any of the victims is still being investigated .
The Hampton Inn posted a statement to the hotel ’s Facebook page Saturday morning :

FPD stated there is no threat to public safety in this case .
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Detective Avery Thompson at 907 - 459 - 6549 or by email at athompson@ci.fairbanks.ak.us .
