City of Columbia agrees to settle with former cop Zim Schwartze
COLUMBIA â€”
The city of Columbia has agreed to settle the wrongful termination lawsuit brought against it by former Columbia Emergency Management Director Zim Schwartze .
The trial was set to begin Monday .

Attorneys for Schwartze requested the court cancel the trial because a settlement had been reached , according to court documents .

Senior U.S.
District Judge Nanette K. Laughrey of the Western District of Missouri dismissed the suit with prejudice , which means the dismissal is final and Schwartze can not bring the suit again at a later date in any court .
The case can be reopened within 45 days if parties can not reach an agreement , according to the court order .

Details of the settlement have not yet been made public .
Schwartze initially sought roughly $ 450,000 in lost wages , benefits and punitive damages , according to previous Missourian reporting .

Schwartze was fired from her position as emergency management director in May 2012 .
She had been in the position since 2009 .

Schwartze alleged that she was fired for statements she made about Police Chief Ken Burton .
City Manager Mike Matthes said that Schwartze was terminated for budgetary reasons .

 Schwartze filed the suit in early 2014 against the city , Burton , Matthes and Deputy City Counselor Cavanaugh Noce .

Schwartze served in the Columbia Police Department for 21 years and became Columbia 's first female police captain by 2003 , according to previous Missourian reporting .
She was hired to manage emergency communications in Springfield in late 2012 after her termination in Columbia .
