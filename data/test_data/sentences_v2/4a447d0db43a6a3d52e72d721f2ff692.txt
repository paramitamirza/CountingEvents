The woman was taken by ambulance to Adirondack Medical Center in Saranac Lake .
Moore said she was in stable condition as of noon , which was the last he had heard .

At The Commons Way outside the apartments , police interviewed a man holding a baby and escorted a pre - school - looking boy into a police car .
Moore said police have located the gun and were still looking for the bullet and its spent shell casing as they process the scene for forensic evidence .

" The only ( criminal ) charges we may be looking at are weapons - related charges , " Moore said .

 Mayor Craig Randall said police told him that the couple 's 3-year - old child was believed to have fired the weapon .

" The thought was that it was a 3-year - old child involved , " Randall said .
" He may have picked it up and certainly not realizing he had a loaded weapon , may out of curiosity pulled the trigger .

" It 's a very , very sad situation if in fact the ultimate investigation bears out those early thoughts . "

Moore said he would not comment yet on whether a child fired the weapon " without a more thorough investigation . "
But he did say the shooting appeared to be the result of the " careless storage of the weapon . "

Landlord Fred Mills , who owns The Commons apartments , said he also heard that it was the toddler who accidentally shot his mother .

" I think it 's just horrible , devastating , " Mills said .
" You hear about this in the paper all the time , but it 's not something you expect to happen . "

A neighbor in the apartment complex reacted with shock , saying he never expected a shooting to occur here .

" I 've been living here 30 years , and there has never been any kind of violence here , " Joe Liberatorie said .
" It 's a perfectly safe place to live . "
