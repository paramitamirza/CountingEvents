5 shot , 1 pistol - whipped at Brooklyn party
A lone gunman shot five Brooklyn gang members and pistol - whipped a teen girl early Tuesday as they headed to a raucous Brooklyn housing project party , police said .

The victims were waiting for an elevator at 60 Glenmore Ave .
in the Howard Houses when the ski - masked shooter appeared at 12:10 a.m. and blasted into the young crowd , police said .

" It was scary , " said neighbor Khadjah Slaughter , 33 , who saw blood all over the hallway floor .
" I 'm going to move . "

A neighborhood activist said the victims were apparently part of a dispute between rival crews from two housing projects .

But victim William Holmes , walking with a cane after he was shot in the right calf and left ankle , said the gunfire began without warning .

The guy just ran up with a ski mask and started shooting , ” said the 16-year - old Frontier High School freshman .
He was shooting at a bunch of us .
He was trying to get all of us .
”

The mother of victim Giovanie Mayo , 18 , said her son told her that the gunman was lying in wait for the teen revelers gathered in the building lobby .

He was hiding and came out of nowhere and shot , ” said Monet Mayor , 45 .
The gang people need to go .
They all need to do hard time . ”

Cops recovered 9-mm .
casings from the blood - spattered lobby , and said the five shooting victims were members of the “
Young Guns Gang , ” a police source said .

The shooter , dressed in dark clothes , fled the Brownsville building and left his bullet - riddled victims bleeding in the lobby .
He remained on the lam hours after the shootings .

The victims — all hit below the waist — had just arrived to attend the sixth - floor party , which was advertised on Facebook .

The pistol - whipped girl , whose name was not released , was 17 .

The gunshot victims were all Brooklyn males : William Holmes and Jayquan Williams , both 16 and shot in the foot ; Giovanie Mayo , 18 , shot in the toe , and Devon James , 18 , shot in the thigh ; and Sharise Randall , 19 , shot in the thigh , cops said .

Tony Herbert , a Brooklyn representative for the National Action Network , said he was worried about the possibility of retaliation over the shootings .

" To me , it 's all just stupidity , " he said .
" They need to understand that you 've got to let go so we can move our community forward . "

Slaughter , the mother of two kids , said she called 311 with a noise complaint about the party just before the gunfire started .

She was hospitalized with a heart arrhythmia after the shootings .

" This never happened before , " she said .
" I 've lived here since I was 12 .
I 've never had an experience with them shooting inside the building . "
