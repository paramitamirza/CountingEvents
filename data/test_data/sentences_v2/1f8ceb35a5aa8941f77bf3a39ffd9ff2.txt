Man asks for justice after brother 's shooter is n't charged - WMC Action News 5 - Memphis , Tennessee
Joshua Cooper 's brother said he thinks there 's more to the story than what he 's being told happened Friday night .
He said his little brother was n't perfect , but was a young man with a bright future ahead of him .

Gregory Cooper said he and his youngest brother Joshua Cooper were best friends .

" He was like my little sidekick , Batman and Robin .
He was the greatest little brother , " Gregory Cooper said .

A straight " A " student who graduated early at age 17 from Hillcrest High School , Gregory said Joshua was starting to realize his potential .

" Here 's something from Williamswood University for Josh , scholarship man , " Gregory said .

That future was taken away from Joshua on Friday when he was shot and died on the street , less than a block away from Methodist Hospital .

" I cried so much my head hurt , " Gregory said .

Police said Cooper met up with a man and woman at the Hillcrest Apartments to buy a gun .
Police said they then got into a struggle over the gun and Cooper was shot .
Those two people surrendered to police .

Police said the district attorney will not be pressing any charges at this time , and the case is an ongoing investigation .

Right now , it 's not clear why Cooper was going to buy a gun .

" That 's not my brother , and I feel like they just need to get to the bottom and find more answers instead of just letting it slide , " Gregory told us .

" I 'm not the type to retaliate ; I believe in being a man of peace . "
