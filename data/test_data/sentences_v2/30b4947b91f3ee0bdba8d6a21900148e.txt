 ( CBS/AP ) ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. - Family and friends will gather at a New Mexico church on Friday to mourn the deaths of a former pastor , his wife and their three youngest children who were allegedly shot by the eldest child , 15-year - old Nehemiah Griego on Jan. 19 .

Friends said Nehemiah 's father , a gang member - turned pastor , raised the family in the Christian faith .
Greg Griego , 51 , went on missions to Mexico and conducted prayer sessions with former jail inmates and weekly Bible study gatherings .
Nehemiah also participated in jam sessions with the Calvary Albuquerque 's youth band and pickup basketball games at the church .

But now Nehemiah is facing murder and child abuse charges in the deaths of his family - Greg Griego , his wife , 40-year - old Sarah Griego , and three of their children : 9-year - old Zephania Griego and daughters Jael Griego , 5 , and Angelina Griego , 2 , all of whom were found shot to death inside their rural home south of Albuquerque .

An hour - long prayer vigil on Wednesday night drew an estimated 2,000 people .

Griego was just a normal teen to Vince Harrison , a former police officer who had known the family for about 10 years through his security work at the church .

" He did not fit the criteria of a kid who was crazy into guns and wanted to hurt people .
That 's absolutely false , " Harrison said .

Detectives continue to pour over evidence gathered last weekend at the Griego home .
They are also reviewing text messages and calls between Griego and his 12-year - old girlfriend , as well as security video from the church where the teen apparently spent much of the day following the early morning shootings .

After the killings , authorities allege that Griego reloaded his parents ' two semi - automatic rifles , put them in the family van and planned to gun down Wal - Mart shoppers .
Sheriff Dan Houston has said investigators have no information that Griego actually went to a Wal - Mart that day .
