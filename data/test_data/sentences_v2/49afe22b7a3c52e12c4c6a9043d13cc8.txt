2-year - old child dead in Pinellas after accidental self - inflicte - WFLA News Channel 8
Kaleb Ahles ' grandparents sobbed as Pinellas detectives investigated the 2-and - a - half - year - old 's death .

Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the boy 's father , Kevin Ahles , put his son in the family car .
As other family members helped Kaleb 's parents move out of their house , at 1094 Misty Hollow Lane in Eastlake , the toddler found a small .380 caliber handgun in the glove box .
He suffered a single , self - inflicted gunshot wound around 4:47 p.m. Wednesday , deputies said .

" It 's just one of those things that happens where everything lined up the wrong way where we had a 2-and - a - half - year - old that was able to take a gun , pick it up , turn it around , and he shot himself dead center in the middle of the chest , " Gualtieri said .

Several witnesses told investigators Kaleb was by himself when the single shot went off .
 "
The father turned around , heard the gun shot go off , turned around , found the child in the car , saw the gunshot wound to his chest , saw the child bleeding , " the sheriff said .

Kaleb 's mother , Christina Nigro , and his aunt started CPR. Paramedics continued on the way to Trinity Hospital , but Kaleb did n't make it and was pronounced dead .

Neighbors were stunned by news of the shooting .

" Any child that has access to a gun and has a tragedy like this is horrifying .
And I work with children
so it 's really close to home , " Elyse Centonze said .

While the investigation is n't over , Gualtieri does n't anticipate charging the boy 's father .

" I do n't think anybody can punish these parents any more than what they 've been punished , " the sheriff said .
