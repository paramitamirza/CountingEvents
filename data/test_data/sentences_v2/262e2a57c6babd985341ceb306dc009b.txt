St. John ’s student , high school student killed at J’Ouvert festival
A promising St. John ’s University student and the son of a Trinidad cop were gunned down in senseless J’Ouvert festival violence on Monday .

Tiarah Poyau ’s dreams of becoming an accountant were cut short when she was struck in the eye by a bullet while attending the Crown Heights street party , an all - night celebration that precedes the annual West Indian Day Parade .

“ It ’s a tragedy that hits too close to home , ” said Poyau ’s neighbor , 57-year - old Anna Jackson , who called for the end of the fest .

The beautiful Poyau , 22 , was a burgeoning career woman who spent the summer as an international tax intern at PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York , according to her LinkedIn profile .

And while she was proud of her internship — her second with the top - five accounting firm — she wrote that her biggest accomplishment was a 2014 study program in which she traveled to Paris , Rome and Seville , Spain .

A friend who visited her grieving family at their East New York home hours after learning of her tragic fate said that Poyau was very career - focused .

“ Tiarah wasn’t a girl running around , ”
the distressed pal said .
She wasn’t out chasing boys .
She was in school , she lived abroad , she did an internship .
She was doing things . ”

The other victim of the early - morning mayhem , 17-year - old Tyreke Borel , was focusing on his studies for his last year of high school , according to his cousin , Chelsea McMillian .

One of his friends told me that he motivated him to go back to school and get his stuff together , ”
McMillian said .
It made me smile because I was motivating him to do the same .
”

Borel ’s mother , Alima St. Clair , was inconsolable at her East Flatbush home as she tried to comprehend the loss of her son , whom she had begged not to go to J’Ouvert .

“ I told him to be safe .
I asked him to stay , but 17-year - olds , they don’t want to stay home , ”
St. Clair said — adding , “ I just want my Tyreke ” as she broke down in tears .

The teen ’s family hails from Trinidad , and he had moved to New York only four years ago to be with his mom and two younger siblings while his father stayed in the Caribbean , where he works as a police officer .

Borel had three minor arrests during his time in the Big Apple , but his family insisted that he was on the right track and thinking about his future .

His great - uncle , David Brathwaite , 56 , said he stepped into a paternal role when Borel came to the city , bringing him out to his auto body shop to teach him the trade .

“ I wanted to be a father figure to him and show him the good side of life , ” he said .
