 BERLIN TWP. , Ohio - A 13-year - old Erie County boy was hospitalized in critical condition after investigators said a friend shot him in the back .

It happened around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday inside victim Matthew Fluty ’s home on the 7900 block of State Route 61 Ceylon Road .

I just accidentally shot my friend , ” the 15-year - old friend told dispatchers .
“ We were shooting guns , and I forgot there was a shell in the chamber .
I thought I cleared it . ”

According to an incident report , the teen told investigators the pair were going to shoot birds in the back yard when he accidentally fired a pump action shotgun loaded with bird shot .
It hit Fluty in the back from between six and nine feet away , deputies said .

There were no adults home at the time , according to investigators .

Fluty ’s grandmother , Carleen Fluty , said she happened to be listening to a police scanner at her home when she heard the dispatch .

“ I heard the Sheriff ask again for the address , and I said , ‘ oh my God , that ’s my grandson , ” Fluty said .

She said she rushed to the house , where she saw her grandson on the living room floor being attended to by first responders .
He was flown to Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo , where he underwent more than five hours of surgery Tuesday .
Fluty said several organs were damaged .

Obviously it was an accident , ” she said .
“ I don’t even know the full details , but I’m a wreck . ”

Erie County Sheriff Paul Sigsworth said detectives met with officials from the Erie County Prosecutor ’s Office , but a decision on potential charges will not be made until the investigation is completed .

“ First of all , we have to make every determination we can that it was purely accidental .
It certainly appears to be at this time , but we have not been able to get a good detailed statement from the victim , ” Sigsworth said .

Sigsworth said the incident is a reminder that guns should always be treated as if they’re loaded , and adults need to supervise children around guns .

Weapons should always be secured within the household , ” he said .
These guns were not secured within the household .
They were accessible to these boys and this is the tragic result .
”

Carleen Fluty said her grandson had experience hunting from a young age , and the guns should’ve been locked up , as there was a gun cabinet in the house .

“ We need all the support we can get , we need prayers for Matthew and his dad , ” she said .
His dad is a single father trying to make a living for both of them .
”

The mother of the 15-year - old declined comment to Fox 8 News .
