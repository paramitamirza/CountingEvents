The music was loud so she did n't hear the shots , but she saw everyone in the club take off in a stampede .

When she noticed Kendall had been shot three times , she loaded him up in her car and drove him to the hospital .
He is expected to recover .

So are all of the others who were shot that night , including a woman eight months pregnant and her then - unborn baby .
