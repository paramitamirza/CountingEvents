 INDIANAPOLIS , Ind. –
A 10-year - old boy died after accidentally shooting himself Sunday night , according to police .

It happened Sunday night near the intersection of Gale and Vermont on Indy ’s east side .
Right now , investigators with the IMPD believe the death is the result of a tragic accident .

The boy was identified Monday as Noah Sarver .

Neighbors say Sarver was a good boy just didn’t understand the dangers of playing with a firearm .

Everybody was out here crying .
It was really sad and to hear his mom crying when they brought his body out , it was sad , ” said neighbor Cindy Masters .

Cindy and several other neighbors didn’t hear the fatal gunshot that killed him , but they did hear the boy ’s father frantically calling for help .

“ I came outside and all I heard was him yelling for help .
He was running back and forth yelling for help , ” said neighbor Paul Martin .

Neighbors say the victim had been playing with a cousin before the shooting .
That cousin told neighbors the boys found the gun in this alley behind the victim ’s home .

Just a few minutes later , it ’s believed Noah pulled the trigger accidentally killing himself .

“ I don’t believe Noah realized the gun was loaded and that ’s what happened , ” said Masters .

At this point in the investigation , from witness statements and other evidence , we believe this to be a tragic accident , ” said IMPD Capt .
Richard Riddle .

Riddle would not say how child got gun , if in fact it was found in the alley or if it belonged to the father .

Our investigators are trying to determine how the child and the other child had this gun in their possession , ” said Riddle .

Neighbors say they don’t blame the boy ’s father for the shooting .

“ I want people to know the father is a great father .
He ’s a good man , ” said Martin .

Police still have to complete their investigation to determine if there was any negligence that could result in criminal charges .
The story is also a reminder for parents to talk to their kids about the dangers of playing with guns .
