Los Angeles firefighters tackle water - based paint blaze
At 10:17 p.m. ( PST ) , fifteen Companies of Los Angeles firefighters , six LAFD rescue ambulances , one arson unit , one urban search and rescue unit , one hazardous materials squad , one foam tender , one EMS battalion captain , four battalion chief officer command teams and one division chief officer command team , all under the direction of Assistant Chief Roy Kozaki responded to a greater alarm fire involving outside chemical storage at 5508 South Bandera St. in South Los Angeles .

Firefighters arrived quickly to face heavy fire from scores of 55-gallon drums stacked three - high and believed to contain flammable water - based paint .

Using handlines in a well - coordinated fashion , firefighters swiftly tackled the blaze , which had destroyed much of a combustible awning - type structure designed to protect the hundreds of drums from the elements .
The flames also consumed the southern half of a fire - sprinklered 30-by-100 foot warehouse .

Thanks to the brisk and effective teamwork of 107 Los Angeles firefighters , the fire was confined to the warehouse and stored liquids and fully extinguished in just 32 minutes .

There were no injuries .

Efforts were made by firefighters to limit and monitor foul - water runoff .
With the possibility that some product may have been carried in the effluent during the firefight , the County Fire Department 's Health Haz - Mat Division was also summoned to the scene .

Fire loss to " Bandera Paint Manufacturing Company " is still being tabulated , while the cause of the fire remains under active investigation .
