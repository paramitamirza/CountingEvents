Age discrimination lawsuit against Chiefs revived
An age discrimination lawsuit filed against the Chiefs has been revived .

On Tuesday , the Missouri Supreme Court vacated a Jackson County jury ’s decision in 2013 that the the NFL organization did not discriminate against a former employee when he was fired .

Steve Cox , formerly a maintenance manager for the Chiefs , claimed he was terminated in 2010 because of his age .
Cox , who was 61 at the time , says he was told that it was because of poor performance .

The Chiefs claimed during the original trial that Cox was fired after he went against the wishes of a supervisor and giving an employee a pay raise .

The jury sided with the Chiefs two years ago , but the Supreme Court judges overturned the trial court ’s ruling on the grounds that it was wrong for the court to preclude 20 other former employees from testifying that they also lost their jobs because they were older .

Their testimony was originally ruled inadmissible by the trial court on the grounds that the employees were directly fired or forced out by different managers and worked in different departments , and were not “ similarly situated ” to Cox .

The Missouri Supreme Court has decided that the case has been remanded , or sent back to trial court , for reconsideration .
