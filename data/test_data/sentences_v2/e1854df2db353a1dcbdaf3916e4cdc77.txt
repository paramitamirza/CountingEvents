Ten people , including a 1-year - old girl , were injured after two suspects used a shotgun , and possibly a handgun , to open fire during a block party in honor of Father 's Day on a West Philadelphia street Saturday night .

The gunfire rang out around 10 p.m. along the 4100 block of Ogden Street .

Witnesses told police that two men opened fire on the block -- at least one had a shotgun .
The suspects , according to witnesses , then got into a gold sedan and fired more shots , possibly with a handgun .

" It looks like they just randomly fired down the street and hit anyone in their way , " said Philadelphia Police Lt .
John Walker .

" We just heard shots and I got up , I picked my baby up and I just started running , " said Valerie Jones .

" I panicked and I just started screaming , ' my baby got shot
, my baby got shot , ' " said Jones .

Luckily , Ashley was back to sipping on juice boxes a day after the shooting .

Gunfire also struck 11- and 12-year - old boys .
All three children were treated at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia in stable condition .
