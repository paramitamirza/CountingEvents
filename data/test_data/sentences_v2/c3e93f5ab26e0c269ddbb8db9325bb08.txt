 Austin - Travis County Emergency Medical Services confirmed the person killed was a woman in her 30s .
Three other women in their 30s were taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge with gunshot wounds while another woman refused transport to the hospital .
All of them are expected to be okay .

Sunday night , police said the suspected gunman , Endicott McCray , 24 , is still at large , but they 've issued a murder warrant for his arrest .

Officials said they believe he may be armed .
McCray is described as 5-feet 9-inches and 130 pounds with long corn rows and a goatee .
Descriptions of the clothes he was last seen wearing have varied , according to the Austin Police Department .
When he is arrested his bond will be set at $ 2 million , police confirm .

Family members of the woman killed identified her as Teqnika Moultrie , 30 .
Moultrie 's brother Ricky , who lives in Las Vegas , Nevada , told KVUE over the phone that Teqnika was in town visiting her fiancée when she was shot on 6th Street .
He said he 's still in shock after learning the news of her death .

" I 'm assuming that they may have went to one of the clubs that are down there to enjoy the Austin nightlife or whatever , and this is what happened , " said Ricky Moultrie .
"
She had nothing to do with it , she 's just not that type of girl . "
