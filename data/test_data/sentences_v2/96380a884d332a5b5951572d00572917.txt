3-year - old boy injured after gun fires near his face
A 3-year - old boy was rushed to the hospital after a gun was fired near his face late Tuesday morning , according to Lt .
Selena Small , with Conway police .

He has since been released from the hospital .

Small around 11:30 a.m. , officers responded to a report of an accidental shooting at a home off Second Avenue in Conway .

Officers say their investigation revealed the father of the child , Jeremy Varieur , 32 , of Conway left a loaded handgun in a location that was accessible by the child .

The child was able to get the handgun and fire it , causing the injury to the side of the boy 's face , Small said .

Neighbors of the dead end street said their kids play with the toddler who was injured and they were shocked to know there was a gun in the house within a child 's reach .

" I think that 's really crazy for a little kid to be playing , or having any access to a gun , " said Larry Skipper , who owns property two doors down from the home where the incident took place .

He is a gun owner himself and his children grew up around them as well .

" As long as they were little my guns were always in a locked up safe where they could n't get to them .
but when they were old enough then I taught them how to use guns , took them hunting and so forth , " he said .

Neighbors said an elderly woman lives at the home and has her grandchildren over frequently .

Lt .
Small said if there are small children in a home with guns , there are steps to take to ensure their safety .

" We just really encourage parents to really always think about gun safety , make sure it 's stored back properly , however they 're storing it in the home and get with the proper people to learn how to properly store it , " Small said .

Skipper believes curious children should be educated when they 're old enough .

He said people should take away a valuable lesson from this unfortunate incident .

" Keep your guns locked up , it 's the best thing to do , " he said .

Varieur is charged with unlawful conduct towards a child .

He is awaiting a bond hearing at the J. Reuben Long Detention Center .
