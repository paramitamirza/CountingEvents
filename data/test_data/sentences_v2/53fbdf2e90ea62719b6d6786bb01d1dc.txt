A shooting at a crowded house party early Sunday left 13 people wounded , and police in Connecticut are investigating what they say is an unusual outburst of violence in the state 's largest city .

It happened around 1:30 a.m. Responding officers discovered what authorities called a chaotic scene .

The party was so crowded that some people believed the gunshots were fireworks , Capt .

Among those shot was Chris Rafael , who said he was hit in the leg while running away from the gunfire .
He said he was in the wrong place at the wrong time .

" They said I 'll be good but Wednesday I have to go back to see how long for recovery , " he said .

The people who threw the party have not been identified by police .
They had requested a permit from police ahead of the gathering because they wanted to sell alcohol there , but the permit was denied , according to Perez .

Police believe they charged for alcohol anyway .
They may face criminal charges , Fitzgerald said .
