Prosecutors have charged a 43-year - old Grandview woman in connection with Monday night ’s shooting of her 4-year - old granddaughter .

Taprill R. Barnett is charged with first - degree felony child endangerment .

According to court records , Barnett ’s daughter brought the girl to her house for a visit .
Barnett told police she was cleaning the gun but slid it under the couch when the victim and another child came into the room .

Barnett said she left the room , heard a pop and returned to find the girl with a gunshot wound to her leg .

“ We are fortunate today that another child was not killed due to the irresponsibility of an adult .
As gun owners , we have the simple responsibility to ensure that these deadly weapons are safely stored .
This isn’t hard , but it is absolutely life and death , ” Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said .

Prosecutors asked for Barnett ’s bail to be set at $ 30,000 and asked that she not be allowed to have unsupervised contact with children .
