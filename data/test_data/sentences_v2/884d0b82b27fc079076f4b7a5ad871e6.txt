Teen struck by stray bullet
A 15-year - old girl working on a family farm was shot in the back from a stray bullet and investigators are trying to determine where the shot originated .

The 15-year - old is expected to recover from her gunshot wound .
At this point the bullet has not been removed , which leaves investigators clueless as to what type of gun was fired .

The shooting was reported to the Stanislaus County Sheriff ’s Department around 3:15 p.m. Sunday at a farm that is off Marshall Road in Crows Landing .
The farm is about a quarter mile east of the Turlock Sportsman Club , said sheriff spokesman Sgt .
Anthony Bejaran .

Sheriff ’s investigators spoke to the members at the club that day and inspected all the guns , Bejaran said .

The club members were not the only shooters that day , however .
There were people on the northwest corner of the San Joaquin River who had also been shooting , Bejaran said .
The identity of those individuals and the types of guns they were shooting is unknown to investigators .
 “
At this point we don’t know where the bullet came from and it ’s possible we may never know , ”
Bejaran said .
“
Without the round we can’t determine the type of gun used .
”

It is not illegal to shoot guns from the riverbank , as long as the people are not trespassing , Bejaran said .

Bejaran said this was the first report of an errant round striking a person in that area .

“
It appears the shooting was unintentional , ” Bejaran said .

Investigators are hoping to speak to the individuals that were shooting from the riverbank .
Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact the sheriff ’s department at 525 - 7114 .
