 Norfolk , Va. - A 26-year - old woman died after being shot in her home on B Ave .
in the Young Park neighborhood of Norfolk over the weekend .

Police say the call came in just after 4:30 p.m.
When they arrived they found 26-year - old Keshira Linnette suffering from a gunshot wound .
She was transported to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital where officials say she was pronounced dead .

As of now police are saying it is an undetermined death , but friends and family say Linnette was accidentally shot and killed by her six - year - old son .

" I 'm not sure if she kept it [ the gun ] there for protection or whether it was put up somewhere or he got it or how long he had been left with it without knowing he had it , " says Linnette 's friend Ayanna Artis .

Artis tells NewsChannel 3 that Linnette 's seven - year - old daughter saw it happen and then tried to find help .

" She ran from there to here to get Aunt Mary because she said she needs her , mama needs some help and she had been shot by her brother .
And they went back over there to try to help her and when they got there that 's what they found , " Artis says .

While she may never get the answers to her questions , she says she 's still praying for the little boy and his siblings who will now grow up without a mother .

" That could separate them .
That could bring them closer .
It could just do so much to them .
They 're so young and their mom is n't here to help them through it , " Artis says .

Police are waiting on results from the Medical Examiner before confirming more details about the shooting .
