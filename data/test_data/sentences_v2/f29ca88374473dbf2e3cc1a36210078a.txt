Lily Coats - Nichols has been taken off of life support and donation of her organs is underway according to her great - aunt Deanna Coats :
 She was taken off life support at noon , she will be in surgery for several hours .
It was gut wrenching when they rolled her little body past us to go to surgery .
That ’s all I know for now .

TOPEKA ( KSNT ) –
Five - year - old Lily Coats - Nichols remains in the hospital on life support Wednesday , as family members deal with a painful decision .

Her father , Bruce Nichols , tells KSNT News that the doctors say damage from the bullet has likely left her brain dead .
It ’s news that friends and loved ones are still trying to understand .

The little kid that could .
I mean , she was littler than all my kids and she could do everything just as good and she just.. She ’s a real good kid , ” said Brian McCracken , who lives across the street from Lily ’s mother .

Very fun to be with .
You know she ’s high spirit , independent , ” said Leroy David McGee Jr. , the next door neighbor .

Lily ’s 5-year - old friends still don’t fully understand what ’s happened .

She ’s just sleeping , ” said 5-year - old Yamilet Marin .

Just a few days ago they were riding bikes , rolling down hills and petting kittens together .

Now friends , family and neighbors are trying to cope with the news that the sweet little girl next door is unlikely to come home .

It hurts , it really does , because little girl was only 5 years old .
She didn’t deserve that , she didn’t deserve that , ” said McGee .

Lily ’s father says doctors tell him she ’s brain dead and bitterly described their medical options .

“ We’ll just cut the tube basically .
Let ’s pull it out and get rid of her organs , that ’s what basically they made it sound like , ” Bruce Nichols said Tuesday .

According to the GoFundMe page created by Lily ’s uncle , she will be “ blessing many others with life from organs she ’s donating .
”
 “ Anywhere you can give a life , even though one was taken is a great opportunity , even though something bad and tragic happened , ” said McCracken .

Not only that , neighbors say her memory will live on through the lilies she used to pick , and…
 “
Where her spirit is concerned , I think it will live on through these little ones [ kittens ] , because that ’s what she was most connected to , ” said McGee .

Lily ’s aunt tells KSNT News all of Lily ’s organs will be donated .

For the time being the family is just waiting on recipients and a transplant team to get everything coordinated ,
but that ’s taking a while .

She says it ’s been horribly hard on the family .
