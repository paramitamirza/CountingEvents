Police insist spate of shootings doesn’t point to crime wave
Two shootings involved gangs .
Two others were accidental – one person “ playing around ”
with a gun , the other firing in celebration of the Fourth of July , Buffalo police said .

Five people were shot .
One died .

And everything took place in just an hour and a half overnight Monday .

Buffalo police on Tuesday tried to assure the public that the sudden spate of shootings didn’t indicate a crime wave .

On holiday weekends , police sometimes see a slight uptick in violence , Buffalo Police Lt .
Jeffrey Rinaldo said at a news conference .
 “
When you have a number of incidents in a short time span , it gives the impression that things are worse than they really might be based on numbers over the long haul of the year , ” he said .

Police said the first two incidents are believed to have been accidental .

At 11:40 p.m. Monday , a 16-year - old Buffalo girl suffered a non - life - threatening gunshot wound after being struck by a bullet that ricocheted on the 200 block of Dartmouth Avenue , near Bailey Avenue .
She walked into Erie County Medical Center just before midnight , and was treated and released .

At 12:10 a.m. Tuesday , a 25-year - old Buffalo man was shot in the leg on the first block of Sattler Avenue .
He was treated and released from ECMC.

The next two shootings are believed to be gang - related :

At 12:35 a.m. , a 21-year - old Buffalo man was shot on the first block of Warren Avenue , at Kent Street .
The man was driven to the ECMC in a private vehicle , and was treated and released .

Just after 1 a.m. , two people were shot , one fatally , near Broadway and Strauss Street .
Police said they are attempting to identify the deceased .

The other victim , a 29-year - old man , suffered non - life - threatening injuries .

Detectives are pursuing a few leads in the Warren Avenue and Broadway shootings , Rinaldo said at the news conference .

Latter 2 were gang related , said Buffalo Police Lt .

Police did not release the names of any of the victims .

The overnight shootings follow a fatal shooting in Cheektowaga on Sunday night and 10 people shot in Buffalo over seven days from June 27 to Monday afternoon .

Among those victims was Juan Rodriguez , 12 , who remains unconscious and in critical condition at ECMC after he was shot in the head June 29 .
He was hit when two warring groups opened fire on each other on Humason Avenue .
The boy opened the door to get his younger siblings to safety when he was struck , his mother ’s boyfriend said .

Buffalo police ask anyone with information about any of the incidents to text or call the department ’s confidential tip line at 847 - 2255 .
