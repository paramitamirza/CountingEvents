Security increased at apartment complex where 5 people were shot
( 09/15/16 ) - There will be more security at the apartment complex near a Mid - Michigan university where five people were shot and injured last weekend .

Law enforcement agencies and the owner of the Campus Village apartments held a press conference Thursday morning to unveil changes in security at the complex .

There was one Saginaw County sheriff 's deputy in another part of the complex when that shooting occurred early Sunday morning .
There will be one more deputy there this weekend .

Saginaw County Sheriff Bill Federspiel , Michigan State Police Lieutenant Dave Simon and John Leuenberger , who owns the complex , made that announcement at the apartments Thursday morning .

“ What we are looking at here is something we have not dealt with before , ”
Federspiel said .

There was a large party Saturday night that continued Sunday morning at the complex , which is across the street from Saginaw Valley State University property .

Police believe a man pulled out a gun and shot five people , all who are recovering with minor injuries .

Not only will there be one more deputy , Michigan State Police will devote some resources in the vicinity of the complex to keep a closer eye on large parties .

Leuenberger says the complex had five security officers on site as well and will try to keep the size of the parties under control .
He does n't believe there was 1,000 people at the party , but he agrees the crowd was too large .

“ We are working with university and the police departments to correct what was wrong and it will be down , ” he said .

“ It ’s in all of our best interests to do whatever we can to develop effective strategies to make sure this does n't happen again , ”
Simon said .

SVSU President Don Bachand has met with police and the complex owners .

“ We have improved our methods of communicating with one another .
We had difficulty communicating with the management folks shortly after the event , ” he said .

Bachand says the school has no jurisdiction over the complex , but the two entities are working on a memorandum - a working agreement to prevent similar problems .

Bachand wants an agreement sooner , rather than later .

“
There is some urgency to what we are doing here , ” he said .

Federspiel says the search continues for the gunman .
