 Deputies said the bodies of Meredith Jessie , 6 , and Mark Weekly , 50 , were discovered during an overnight search .

The Polk County Sheriff 's Office said the child 's mother , Cheyenne Jessie , 25 , has been arrested and charged with two counts of first - degree murder .

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Jessie killed her father and daughter July 18 and placed their bodies in a shed .

Judd said Jessie got the idea from the television show " Criminal Minds " to put the bodies in plastic bins and hide them , then call after a few weeks passed and report them missing .

Weekly and the 6-year - old were reported missing Saturday .

" Here 's what we can tell you .
A beautiful child , 6 years old , was viciously murdered by her mother .
The question is : did she first witness the vicious murder of her grandfather ? "
Judd said .

Investigators allege Jessie shot and stabbed her father and daughter July 18 after she got into an argument with her father over her boyfriend .
She moved them to the shed four days later , they said .

A couple who said they know the family claimed Jessie often complained about her daughter .

" I know she did n't like her daughter too much .
I do know that .
Cause she says she 's always in trouble .
She 's a handful .
She screams and shouts at her .
But she do n't do that with her granddad , " Ruby Poore said .

The sheriff said Jessie claimed she killed her father in self - defense during their argument and that the child was caught in the middle .
Deputies said the story does n't add up .
