Los Angeles firefighters quickly contain large structure blaze
At 5:14 p.m. ( PST ) , seventeen Companies of Los Angeles firefighters , five LAFD rescue ambulances , two arson units , one urban search and rescue unit , one hazardous materials squad , one EMS battalion captain , four battalion chief officer command teams and one division chief officer command team , all under the direction of Battalion Chief Joseph Foley responded to a greater alarm structure fire at 16542 Ventura Blvd .
in Encino .

Firefighters arrived quickly and despite initially discovering no signs of active fire at the five story sealed office building , immediately initiated LAFD 's high rise operations plan .
The building 's fire control room was identified while the lobby and elevators were promptly secured .

As firefighters swiftly aided more than a dozen occupants in safely exiting the 40,295 square - foot multi - tenant building , they received reports of moderate smoke on the north end of the uppermost floor .

Given this information , additional LAFD resources were requested as teams of firefighters climbed stairs with the hundreds of pounds of equipment necessary to battle a potential high - rise fire .

Clearing each floor of the building as they ascended the stairs , firefighters established a logistics and support base on the a fourth floor as well as a rooftop ventilation group as they investigated pervasive smoke within the office and attic above a 5th floor orthodontic suite .

Aided by strategic opening of the composition roof over plywood sheathing by firefighters using chainsaws , the considerable smoke and heat from the fire was quickly vented vertically with the aid of positive pressure fans as firefighters fully extinguished a stubborn fire among the wooden rafters and recently applied roofing materials in just 37 minutes .

Quick and skillful teamwork by 117 members of the LAFD kept this fire above the attic and out of multitude of offices , several of which were undergoing renovation .

Firefighters were quick to credit building occupants for their prompt yet calm evacuation upon hearing the fire alarm , and for their swift activation of the 9 - 1 - 1 system .

There were no civilian or firefighter injuries .

Loss from the fire is estimated at $ 30,000 ( $ 20,000 structure and $ 10,000 contents ) .
The cause of this early evening blaze is attributed to a roofing operation earlier in the day .
