The two male victims of a 20-year - old college student were identified on Tuesday night after they were shot dead in the street during a murder and carjacking spree .

Authorities reported at least five places where victims had been shot in the early morning violence - and at least four are dead - including Syed who took his own life .

Authorities said Syed was taking one course at Saddleback College , a two - year community college .

The shootings began at 4.45am when deputies responding to a call found the body of a female who was shot multiple times in a house in Ladera Ranch , Orange County sheriff 's spokesman Jim Amormino said .
