According to the sheriff 's office , the 9-year - old girl was asleep on the couch at the time .
Detectives said at least 30 rounds were fired into the home by an undetermined number of individuals , who arrived and left in an unknown vehicle .
At least three different kinds of shell casings were found at the scene .

Officials said one of the occupants of the home returned fire , shooting at least six rounds at the suspects .

The girl was struck in the leg and was taken to Arnold Palmer hospital in stable condition .

Besides the victim , there were four adults and one other child at the home during the shooting .
No one else was hurt .

A neighbor said she heard the gunfire in the home nearby
 " What is this world coming to ?
A 9-year - old girl ? " said neighbor Debbie Kurchoff .

Since June , officials said there have been 18 calls to the house alone , including an aggravated battery call in March .

" We have extra patrols now and in the foreseeable future , " said Jane Watrel with the Orange County Sheriff 's Office .

The Orange County sheriff is in the early planning stage of exploring a violence task force .

Community activists like Jack Williams of Stop the Violence and Embrace think something needs to happen now .

More neighborhood watches , or cash incentives , might be used to report crime before it happens .

" I think incentives would work , just like it does with Crimeline .
We ca n't stop all the crime .
We ca n't stop all the violence , but we can make a dent in it , " Williams said .

As detectives look for the people who put a young girl in the hospital and wreaked havoc on a neighborhood 's peace of mind , Williams asks that the code of silence be forgotten .

" We 've got to get past that , community I plead to you .
Break that silence in the community .
It 's stupid , it 's ignorant , " Williams said .

Anyone who was in the area at the time of the shooting should contact Crimeline at 1 - 800 - 423-TIPS ( 8477 ) .
