EAST ORANGE - An East Orange church says that it will pay the funeral expenses for a 4-year - old boy who was shot and killed by his brother , who somehow got ahold of their mother ’s gun .

The reverend at the New Hope Baptist Church says that the church will fully pay for the funeral for 4-year - old Christopher Lassiter .

" The fact that the mother is in jail , a 4-year - old is dead and a 5-year - old is responsible is a tragedy , and our church wants to be there to support and help them , ” says the Rev. Dwight Gill .

The boys’ mother , 22-year - old Itiyanah Spruill , is charged with endangering the welfare of a child and a weapons violation .

Officials say that Spruill ’s 5-year - old son found her loaded gun and accidentally shot his brother Saturday on Norman Street in East Orange .

News 12 New Jersey is told that the boys were under a grandmother ’s guardianship , but were often seen at Spruill ’s home .

Spruill is due to appear in Essex County Court Tuesday morning .
According to court records , Spruill has previously been in trouble with the law .
She ’s previously been charged for unlawful possession of a gun .

Christopher Lassiter ’s funeral is set for Friday at 10 a.m. and will be open to the public .
Rev. Gill says that they are still trying to figure out if Spruill will be allowed to attend .
