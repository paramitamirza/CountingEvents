 Detroit— Decrying the no - snitch silence that descended over a west side neighborhood after a block party erupted in violence , leaving one dead and 11 others shot , Police Chief James Craig on Sunday pleaded with witnesses to come forward and identify the " urban terrorists . "

The chief and detectives canvassed the area of Dexter and Webb looking for clues to the shooting that marred the start of summer in a barrage of gunshots Saturday .
Police called the shooting retaliatory and labeled the shooters " cowardly thugs . "

Craig said officers are seeking two men believed to have exchanged gunfire with the victim , 19-year - old Malik Jones .

But Craig said the " neighborhood is not talking " and urged witnesses to help them catch the two shooters .
He said 47 shots were fired at the annual neighborhood basketball game , attended by families .

" We 're making a passionate plea to the community to talk .
They need to respond , " Craig said .
" They 're fed up and we 're fed up .

" As I have said time and again , the police can not do this alone . "

Craig said he did n't have statistics with him but believed the past weekend was one of the most violent weekends of the year in Detroit .

In a separate incidents , a 19-year - old woman was wounded by gunshot while walking on Monroe in Greektown on Saturday night , police said .
And early Sunday morning , a would - be robber entered Pete 's Grill and Coney Island at Outer Drive and Dequindre announcing a holdup .
A cook in the restaurant shot the man several times , killing him .

The shootings extended to Sunday evening , injuring a woman and her 2-year old , innocent bystanders in neighborhood argument over dogs .

Jones , the homicide victim in the Dexter and Webb shootout , was killed three blocks from where he lived .
Craig said Jones had been shot about a month ago in the neighborhood .

The other victims ranged in age from 19 to 47 , Craig said , adding that seven are recovering at home and four remain in the hospital in stable condition .

Police say someone opened fire about 8:30 p.m. Saturday at a party on a basketball court where about 300 people were gathered .

Community activist Helen Moore , president of the Dexter Elmhurst Community Center , said the basketball game was not sponsored by the center , which owns the parking lot used as a basketball court .

Moore , who was not present , said the area often hosts community events .
She said she was not aware of any notification that an event was planned there Saturday night .

" We are going to have a community meeting and encourage people to talk so this does n't happen again , " Moore said .
" We can work with them and work with police for additional patrols . "

Moore said the community center has been the target of vandals and thieves in recent years , including rooftop thefts of equipment and metal , which have affected the center 's operations .

Jerome Thompson , 65 , lived in the neighborhood most of his life , but said he recently moved to Warren because of break - ins and other crime .

" It 's sad , " he said , looking at the scene of Saturday 's shooting .
" I was raised on this court . "

The neighborhood surrounding the run - down parking lot is filled with dilapidated , abandoned store fronts .

Craig stayed in the neighborhood talking with a handful of passers - by for about 20 minutes after the Sunday afternoon news conference .
That included two teens , one bouncing a basketball , who walked down Dexter .

" Do you know who I am ? "
Craig asked them , before peppering them with questions and telling them the department needed their help to catch the shooter .

Another , who pedaled past the basketball courts on a bicycle , shouted out his appreciation to Craig for helping to make the city safer .

" You 're doing a good job , " the youth shouted out , to which Craig wearily replied , " Not today . "

Jones was well - known and popular in the neighborhood , said Melissa Brown , a childhood friend who watched the Sunday news conference from a bus stop across Dexter .

"
He loved to smile , " Brown said .
" Everybody out here loved Malik , and the police are n't going to find his killer . "

She said witnesses likely wo n't come forward because they do n't believe police will protect them .
Brown said she 's angry that officers did n't do a better job of monitoring the game .
It has been an annual event for years , and police should have been better prepared , she said .

" The police should have been out there , " Brown said .
" You need to treat this area like you do downtown .
None of these cops care about this neighborhood . "

" It 's been going on too long for them not to know . "

Police said they had been in the area a few hours before the shooting , clearing the streets of cars , and that participants had cooperated .

" We had made our presence known , " said Capt .
Nick Kyriacou , who said a preliminary investigation indicates someone was in pursuit of Jones , who " for whatever reason decided to conceal himself in a crowd " before the shooting .

" This ( shooting incident ) is an anomaly , " Craig said .
" Crime in general and violent crime specifically have both been trending down ( here ) .
At least , until recently .

" You have 12 people shot in one incident , and that is going to make the numbers go up . "

The shooting came two days before Detroit 's annual fireworks show , set for 10:06 p.m. Monday .
The fireworks caps the city 's four - day River Days festival .

Craig had pushed for a citywide curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. for minors ages 17 and younger for four nights beginning Friday and ending Monday for River Days , but it was defeated by the Detroit City Council in a 4 - 3 vote Tuesday .
The council narrowly favored a curfew for the fireworks show Monday that will run from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. and be limited to downtown .

Kyriacou said efforts were being made to arrange a community meeting " as soon as possible " this week to discuss the shooting .

" We want to bring all the stakeholders together — the neighborhood 's residents , the people who were at the shooting , community groups — so we can get the people responsible , " said Kyriacou .
" We are not going to let them bring the community or the city down . "

One person who plans to attend the community meeting is Garland Hardeman , a member of a neighborhood block group , who said numerous concerns need to be addressed .

" We have to get together , " Hardeman said after talking briefly with Craig .
" The neighborhood and police and everyone . "

Police were passing out ( 800 )
SPEAK UP leaflets to residents and putting them in doorways with the hope of getting tips with information about those responsible for shooting .

Anyone with information can also call ( 313 ) 596 - 1616 .
