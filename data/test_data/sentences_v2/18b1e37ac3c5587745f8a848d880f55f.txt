Boy shoots sister in the back of the neck in Franklinton
COLUMBUS ( WCMH ) —
A 3-year - old girl is recovering tonight at Nationwide Children ’s Hospital after being accidentally shot by her 4-year - old brother .

Investigators say the mother was home with the children .
The boy got access to a loaded gun , and fired it , hitting the girl in the back of the neck .

Police responded to the 400 block of Glenwood Avenue shortly after 9:30 a.m. Monday and found the girl .
She is expected to live .

“ I think we have a tragedy very narrowly averted , ” detective Jay Fulton of Columbus Police said .

Neighbors watched in disbelief as the little girl was taken away in a medic .

“ I wanted to go to the emergency room with her so badly but they wouldn’t let me , ” neighbor Sandra Myers said .
“
It hurts so bad I couldn’t go .
And I wanted also to go comfort the little boy . ”

Others in the neighborhood say this hits too close to home .
Amber Litton said it “ breaks ( her ) heart .
”

“
I have a 5-year - old , ” she said .
“ ( It ’s ) something I couldn’t imagine going through .
”

Police say no charges have been filed , but investigators will do interviews before taking the information to the city attorney ’s office .

What investigators say at this point is if you have a gun , know where it is and make sure that is away from kids .
 “
If you have guns in the home and small children , make it inaccessible , ” Fulton said .
“ If they see you handle it , the minute you are gone they’ll handle it . ”
