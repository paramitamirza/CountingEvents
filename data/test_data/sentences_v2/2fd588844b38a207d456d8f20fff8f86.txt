Good Samaritans Respond to Bus Fire
No injuries were reported in connection with a bus fire in downtown Chattanooga this afternoon , thanks in part to four Good Samaritans .
At 3:30 p.m. , Carol Ward was driving the Orange Grove mini bus around the 400 block of Broad Street when she started having engine problems .
With her was another Orange Grove staff member , along with three adult clients and one school - age client .
When the engine problems continued , she pulled the bus over to the curb and stopped .
That 's when fire erupted in the engine compartment .

As the fire quickly spread , the Orange Grove employees struggled to get their clients off the bus .
Four men who happened to be nearby saw the commotion and ran to the bus to help .
Kenneth Chope , 25 , Maurice Vaughn , 36 , David Vogt , 27 , and Will Wallace , 37 , got the employees off , and then quickly lifted the clients out as the fire spread to the rest of the bus .
While they were at it , they called 9 - 1 - 1 for help .
No one was injured .

Chattanooga firefighters got most of the fire out quickly , but Battalion Chief Mack Moore said their efforts were hampered by the burning engine , which had components made of magnesium .
Magnesium reacts violently with water , so the firefighters used dry powder extinguishers to get the fire completely out .
The exact cause of the fire is not known , but it is believed to be related to a mechanical malfunction .
