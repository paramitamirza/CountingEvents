JONESBORO , AR ( KAIT ) â€“
There is an update to the condition of at least one person injured in Saturday 's shootings .

Police tell Region 8 News Brayam Davila , age 10 , was released from the hospital on Tuesday and is at home .
The child had been shot in the upper thigh .

On Sunday police released the names of those killed and injured in Saturday afternoon 's shootings .
Police also identified the suspect and gave some insight into what exactly happened that killed four people and injured four others in three separate locations .

Jonesboro Police Chief Mike Yates identified the suspect as Porfirio Hernandez , age 40 .
Hernandez 's body was found in a vehicle on County Road 664 east of Jonesboro several hours after the initial shooting .
Yates said Hernandez committed suicide with the same weapon used in the earlier shootings .
Hernandez was released from a mental hospital , possibly in the past week .
Yates said they were working to determine which institution he was in .

In a Sunday morning news conference Chief Yates said the first call to 911 came in around 1:00pm Saturday about a shooting at 2201 Moore Road in east Jonesboro .
There six people had been shot .
Two people died at the scene including Crisanto Islas , age 38 and Floza Davila , age 12 .

While Brayam Davila was released from the hospital and is at home , three others remain in Memphis hospitals .
The survivors are Brayam 's mother , Ayde Davila , age 36 , Anquel Islas , age 8 , and Augusten Hernandez , age 43 .
As of Tuesday , there is no official word on their conditions .

Yates says there were several other people in the home , but managed to run from the gunfire .
Hernandez used a .357 magnum handgun in the shootings .
Yates said it appears as though he had to reload the weapon given the gun 's six bullet capacity .
All but one victim in the home was shot in the head .
Brayam Davila was shot in the hip .
Witnesses say Hernandez said nothing as he opened fire and continued shooting through the home .

Hernandez took a vehicle from the Moore Road home and drove nearly three miles to Dalton Farmer Drive near U.S. 63 and Commerce .
Yates said Hernandez pulled into a parking lot where Ricardo Lopez , age 31 was working at a construction site .
When Lopez approached the vehicle Hernandez shot and killed him .
That shooting took place approximately 20 minutes after the Moore Road shooting .

Witnesses at both locations described the same suspect and vehicle and police determined Hernandez was the only suspect .
Around 3:30pm a vehicle matching the description was found on County Road 664 .
Inside Craighead County deputies discovered Hernandez 's body in the driver 's seat with a gunshot wound to the head .

According to witnesses , the shooter was known to the victims as a friend or acquaintance .
Chief Yates said the suspect was not known to police before yesterday 's shooting .
Yates said this is an unusually difficult case given the victims and witnesses speak little English and are in hospitals in another state .

Yates said they did not know how Hernandez , who was recently released from a mental facility , obtained the weapon .
He said investigators are working to find out .

Approximately 45 officers from Jonesboro , Bay , Brookland , Arkansas State Police , and Craighead County Sheriff 's office responded to the shooting scenes .
