An 18-year - old man is charged with shooting and killing a man heâ€™d been friends with since the sixth grade .

Kenneth Murphy was charged late Tuesday night with the shooting death of Christopher Rodriguez , 20 , at a home in Pittsburgh 's Allentown neighborhood .

A witness initially told police that Rodriguez had arranged to sell Murphy a gun at the house on Arlington Avenue .
That same witness said that they got a call 20 minutes later saying Rodriguez had been shot .

According to court paperwork , Murphy was interviewed on Tuesday , saying he and Rodriguez were good friends who had gone to school together since the sixth grade .

The paperwork shows at one point Murphy broke down and claimed the shooting was an accident .

He said he had agreed to buy the gun from Rodriguez for $ 450 and the two were playing with weapons and negotiating prices when one of the guns went off .
Murphy claims he had thought the gun was unloaded .

Police said Murphy then went to his girlfriend and confessed that he did something " unbelievable . "

Investigators said Murphy later led them to a wooded area near the home where he had discarded the guns after the shooting .

Murphy faces several charges including criminal homicide .
