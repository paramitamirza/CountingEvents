A 2-year - old girl is recovering after being accidentally shot in the neck by her 3-year - old sister in Terrell Tuesday afternoon .

The girls’ father , 25-year - old Elroy Caleb Middleton , admitted to police that he left them alone in his truck while he met with a coworker at Southwestern Christian College .
He said he was standing just a few feet away from the truck when he heard a gunshot .

Police said the 3-year - old toddler managed to grab a loaded handgun from under the front seat and shoot her sister .

Middleton reportedly showed up at the Terrell Police Department looking for help .
Police said he was screaming and pounding at the door , but by the time officers got outside they could only find his pickup truck with the engine running and the 3-year - old still inside .

After a search around the area , police found the distraught father at a nearby fire station .
He had his injured daughter , who was also screaming and crying because of the bullet in the upper left side of her neck .

Middleton explained to FOX 4 he lives on campus at Southwestern Christian College and works with security .
He said he put the gun under his seat to sell it at a pawn shop for money to buy his son a birthday present .
He said he typically loads his gun every night and unloads it every morning and stores it in a safety deposit box .

Middleton also said he put the girls in their car seats and stepped feet away to talk to a security guard on campus .
He said in those minutes , the girls wiggled out of their car seats and got on the floor in the back seat .
When his older daughter found the gun , she fired .
 “
In the moment , I was just rushing just to get it to the pawn shop just to see how much money I could get from it , ”
Middleton said .
“ I’m willing to admit that it was a mistake that I made .
”
 Police found the loaded 9 mm handgun in the truck .
Although Middleton said he was “ with security , ” police said he is not a state licensed security officer and does not have a license to carry permit .

It is not a violation of state law to possess a firearm in a vehicle in Texas .
However , it is a violation to make a weapon accessible to a minor .
A full investigation is being conducted into the incident and any applicable charges will be filed at the conclusion of the investigation .

" That certainly would not be the most responsible of behaviors , and that certainly played a role in what happened , " said Terrell PD Capt .
Arley Sansom .

The injured 2-year - old was rushed Children ’s Medical Center in Dallas .
Fortunately Middleton said she did not require surgery and could be released on Wednesday .

He said his oldest daughter is shaken up and thinks she did something wrong .
