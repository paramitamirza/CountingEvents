 A nine - month - old baby was shot and severely wounded on Sunday by her father , who told New York City police his gun accidentally discharged while he was cleaning it .

Police in Brooklyn responded to a 911 call on Saturday afternoon and found the baby girl with a gunshot wound to her lower left abdomen , a spokeswoman from the New York City Police Department said .

The baby was struck by a bullet from a .45 caliber handgun that had been obtained illegally , the spokeswoman said .
The baby was rushed to a nearby hospital for surgery , she said .

The child ’s father , Pedro Rosales , 47 , told officers the gun accidentally discharged as he was cleaning it inside their apartment in Brooklyn ’s East New York neighborhood , striking his daughter .

He was arrested on charges of assault , reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon .

The baby ’s mother , Jessica Aguilar , 24 , who was home during the incident , was also arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and acting in a manner injurious to a child , the police spokeswoman said .

It was unclear if the couple had attorneys or how they intended to plead to the charges at an arraignment this week .

The incident came a day after a 3-year - old boy in Washington state was shot in the mouth , apparently by a 4-year - old neighbor , as the two played in the wounded child ’s Lake Stevens home , local law enforcement officials said .
