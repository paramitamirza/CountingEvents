 HENDERSON COUNTY , Tenn. — Deputies say a man was killed in a Christmas Day shooting and a 15-year - old is a person of interest in the homicide investigation .
 “
I’m doing a lot of praying right now , ”
Marilyn Cannon said .
Family members describe this as a Christmas tragedy .

The Henderson County Sheriff ’s Department says 23-year - old Julius Gray died after he was shot Sunday morning in a mobile home on Middleburg Road .

You kind of hope it ’s not him because you didn’t see him , but you know it ’s him , ” Gray ’s sister , Mary Smith Elrod , said .

Deputies say the person of interest is a 15-year - old juvenile and that the incident happened while both of them were sitting on a couch .

She shared how investigators describe her brother ’s death .

He was standing there pointing a gun at my brother , and he said ‘ are you scared now,’ and my brother said ‘ no , I’m not .
I’m not afraid to die,’ and then he pulled the trigger , ”
Elrod said .

The family says Gray was staying at the mobile home and that his daughter is now without a father .

Her name is Abrianna , and that was his world , ” his aunt Marilyn Cannon said .

His sister says she just saw her brother and the 15-year - old together before the holiday .

This boy ate Christmas dinner with my family Friday night , ” Elrod said , referring to the teenager .

Neighbors who didn’t want to go on camera said they believe the shooting was accidental .

The family disagrees .
I don’t call pointing a gun in someone ’s face and pulling the trigger — I don’t call that an accident , ” Elrod said .

Who lets a 15-year - old child have a gun ? ”
Cannon said .

Deputies say one shot was fired .
They have not released a cause due to the open investigation .

“ We do want justice , but right now we would be appreciative to have some information , ” Elrod said .

The District Attorney ’s Office is reviewing the case .
Deputies say charges could come later .
