A dangerous discovery , and a curious child .

Clare police say the accidental shooting happened while the two were inside their grandma 's van , waiting to go to their homeschool .
 “
The initial call came in as an accidental shooting involving two children , ” says Clare Police Chief Brian Gregory .
It sounds preliminarily that the young boy found the registered hand gun inside the vehicle , and when he picked it up it discharged .
”

That 's when police say he found the gun and it went off , accidentally shooting himself in the hand , and his relative in the thigh .

“ We do know that both children are OK and they are going to obviously have some work done to help them , but they have no life threatening injuries at this time , ” says Chief Gregory .

Police say the gun was registered to the boy and girl 's relative .

Neighbors say they 're blown away the boy found the gun and accidentally shot himself and cousin .

I was very shocked when you said that .
I knew that something was wrong , but I had no idea
it was like that , ” says neighbor Don Fernelius .

”

Despite there being non - life threatening injuries , police say his could have ended worse .

We always think that things like this are just obvious to gun owners , unfortunately now a days with people 's hectic lives and everything that 's going on for people , whether they are legal licensed carriers or not , if they are in possession of a hand gun they need to know where that is at all times , ” explains Chief Gregory .
