Police : Benton Child Dead after Being Shot
- LITTLE ROCK , Ark. - A two - year - old boy has died after being shot on Tuesday afternoon , police say .

At 1:35 p.m. , the Benton Police Department said it was called about the child being shot at a home on Nelson Court .

The child was taken to a local hospital where local law enforcement responded .

After that , the child was taken to a Little Rock hospital for additional treatment but died as a result of his injuries .

The investigation is ongoing , but no charges were filed on Tuesday .

Tuesday evening , a family member told us the boy shot himself in the head with a handgun .

" If you 're shot in the head with a .45 [ pistol ] , you 're not going to make it , " said Doyle David Ashley , the boy 's uncle .
"
Nobody likes to hear of a kid getting killed by a gun .
It 's not right . "

Ashley said he does not understand how his two - year - old nephew got his hands on such a lethal weapon .

" It 's hard to believe a child playing with a gun that big and that heavy , " Ashley said .
" I 'm for guns .
I 'm not against them .
It 's not the gun that pulls the trigger .
It 's the person behind it .
But when you 're dealing with a child , they do n't know if that gun is loaded or not loaded .
That creates a problem .
All responsibility falls on the parents to keep those guns put up that are loaded . "

The Benton Police Department will continue its investigation to find that answer .

In the meantime , Ashley said he will remember the joy his nephew brought the family .

" He was such a fun little two - year - old , " he said . "
He liked being around his daddy and doing things with his daddy and he liked being outside .
It 's a bad thing .
It 's not good . "

The two - year - old 's father told us he and his family are just asking for everyone 's prayers during this difficult time .
 "
He was proud of his little boy , " Ashley said .
" It tore him up .
Nobody that loses a child over something like that is going to be easy to live with .
You 're going to have a problem because that could have been avoided . "
