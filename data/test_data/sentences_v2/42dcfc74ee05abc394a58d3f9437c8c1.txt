 PHILADELPHIA ( CBS ) —
Authorities say one person is dead and another is in critical condition after six total people were shot Sunday evening in the Kingsessing section of Philadelphia .

The shooting happened around 7 p.m. at 54th Street and Florence Avenue just outside a deli .

Sources say a man walked up to the corner and just started shooting .
A car believed to be with the shooter also pulled up on the opposite side of the group , almost boxing the victims in , and also began firing .

The first victim was pronounced dead on the scene , while the other victims were rushed to area hospitals for treatment .
One of them is said to be in critical condition while the other four are stable .

None of the victims have been identified , but police say their ages range from 18 to 23 years old .
All the victims are male .

Police say despite the large crowd out at the time of the shooting , so far no one claims to have seen or heard anything .

Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said Monday morning that detectives will look to see if Sunday night ’s shooting is retaliation from a previous murder in the area .

“
There was a homicide there in late September , at least in that area .
We don’t know if any of the victims were alleged to have been a part of that , if that had something to do with it , or if this is a different kind of dispute .
”

Police say they don’t have any suspects identified .

The shooting remains under investigation .
