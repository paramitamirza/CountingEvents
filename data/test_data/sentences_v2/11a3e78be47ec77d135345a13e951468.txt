For the second time in as many days a child has wounded himself in an accidental shooting in the Houston area .

No charges are expected in the most recent case after a 7-year - old accidentally shot himself in the head Wednesday when he got into his grandfather 's locked gun cabinet in Brazoria County .

The incident happened about 11 a.m. in the 4000 block of East Texas 6 in Alvin , according to the Brazoria County Sheriff 's Office .

Deputies said the boy grabbed a .38 caliber revolver from the cabinet and pulled the trigger .
The bullet went into the boy 's forehead just below the hairline , traveled under the skin on the crown of his head and then exited without piercing his skull .

The boy is expected to recover .

The grandparents , deputies said , will not face any charges since their grandson had to make great efforts to the find the key to the locked gun cabinet .

The incident came a day after another boy , believed to be 5 years old , shot himself in the face at a home in northwest Harris County .

That shooting happened about 6:15 p.m. Tuesday in the 9700 block of Shady Tree Lane , according to the Harris County Sheriff 's Office .
The child was rushed to the Texas Medical Center .
He died on Thursday .

Deputies said the Tuesday shooting also appeared to be accidental and investigators were trying to determine how the boy got his hands on the gun .
No charges have been filed yet , but officials said they are unsure if any charges will be pursued .

" This very serious , " a family friend posted in Spanish on Facebook Wednesday .
" They do not give us hope , but I know that we believe and trust in a powerful God who does miracles . "
