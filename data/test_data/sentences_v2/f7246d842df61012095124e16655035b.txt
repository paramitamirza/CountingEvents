Teen survives accidental rifle shot to mouth
LIMA —
A 17-year - old boy is lucky to be alive after he was shot in the face over the weekend .

Kaleb Davis was taken to Toledo Children ’s Hospital where he was placed in a medically induced coma so a breathing tube could be placed into his throat until the swelling subsided , Allen County sheriff investigators said .

The shooting appears to be accidental and both teens are friends with no animosity between the two , Sheriff ’s Sgt .
Mark Baker said .

“
There is no indication there was any foul play .
There is no reason to believe anything else happened , ” Baker said .

The shooting happened Saturday at 11:15 p.m. Davis was sleeping in a chair at the home of his friend , Gregory Lambert , 19 .
The home is at 4251 Reservoir Road , authorities said .

Lambert was hunting groundhogs earlier in the day and left his .22 caliber rifle on his bed after he finished .
Lambert left Davis sleeping in a chair and was going to go to bed himself , authorities said .

Lambert attempted to remove the rifle from the bed at which time he somehow pulled the trigger as he grabbed the rifle .
The round struck Davis in the mouth knocking out a tooth and lodging into Davis throat , authorities said .

When deputies and emergency responders arrived at the house , Davis was up and walking , holding a towel to his mouth .
Davis told a deputy he woke after something happened to his mouth .

The incident appears to be an accident with a rifle from careless gun handling , Baker said .

The case will be presented to the Prosecutor ’s Office to determine if any charges will be filed .
At most , Baker said it would be a negligent assault , which is a misdemeanor .
