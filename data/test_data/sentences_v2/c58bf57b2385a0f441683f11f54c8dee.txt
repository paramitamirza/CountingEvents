A second man has been charged in the 2015 slaying that led to the execution - style murder of 9-year - old Tyshawn Lee later that year .

Tyshawn was playing near swings in Auburn Gresham on Nov. 2 when a gunman lured the boy into an alley and shot him multiple times , according to prosecutors .
The accused shooter later bragged about the murder , claiming he wanted to kill more children .

 Authorities have long said the slaying was retaliation for an Oct. 13 gang shooting in which Tracey Morgan was murdered and Morgan 's 56-year - old mother was shot in her arm .
Tracey Morgan 's brother , Corey Morgan , was so enraged that he reportedly threatened to shoot " grandmas , mamas , kids and all " in retaliation .

Prosecutors on Thursday charged 23-year - old Khalil Yameen — who is allegedly in the same gang as Tyshawn 's dad — in that Oct. 13 shooting .
Alleged accomplice Christopher Smith was charged Friday .
Cook County Judge James Brown denied both men bail .

Earlier this year , Brown described Tyshawn 's murder as " a crime that has shocked the city to its core .
It actually shocked the entire nation ... that a 9-year - old boy could be executed while playing basketball because he was related to a gang member ... through no fault of his own . "

Tyshawn Lee , 9 , was killed Nov. 2 .

According to prosecutors , both Tyshawn 's slaying and the Oct. 13 slaying stemmed from " an ongoing gang war " between the BBG ( Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples .

Yameen , Smith and Tyshawn 's father ( Pierre Stokes ) are believed to be Gangster Disciples , while Tracey Morgan and the three men charged in Tyshawn 's murder —
Corey Morgan , Dwright Boone - Doty and Kevin Edwards — are reportedly Black P Stones .

On Oct. 13 , Tracey Morgan 's mother was driving Morgan home from a mandatory parole meeting when she noticed a silver sedan following them , Assistant State 's Attorney Jamie Santini said during a bond hearing Friday .

That car soon cut in front of Tracey Morgan and his mother , while a second vehicle pulled up from behind — boxing in the Morgan family near 83rd Street and Lafayette Avenue , prosecutors said .

At that point , Smith and Yameen got out of the two cars , pulled guns and began shooting at Morgan 's mother 's car , Santini said .

Tracey Morgan was fatally shot 11 times in his arm , abdomen , thigh , buttocks and foot , according to prosecutors .
His mother was shot once in her arm and was able to eventually drive to a nearby gas station for help after the two other vehicles left the scene , Santini said .

Police would later recover 17 shell casings and six bullet fragments , according to prosecutors .

Both Tracey Morgan and his mother were taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center , where Morgan was pronounced dead .

Smith and Yameen are charged with first - degree murder and attempted first - degree murder .

The Oct. 13 shooting led to multiple retaliatory incidents , Santini said , including an Oct. 18 shooting that killed 19-year - old Brianna Jenkins and the Nov. 2 shooting that killed 9-year - old Tyshawn Lee .

After the Oct. 13 shooting , Corey Morgan , Boone - Doty and Edwards went out daily , armed with guns , looking for someone to shoot , prosecutors have said .

On Nov. 2 , the group was riding in Edwards ' black SUV when they spotted Tyshawn at Dawes Park near 80th Street and Damen Avenue , according to authorities .

The boy was playing on a swing when Boone - Doty got out of the SUV , walked toward Tyshawn and began dribbling a basketball the boy had brought with him to the park , Santini said .

That 's when Boone - Doty allegedly lured Tyshawn into an alley by offering to buy the boy anything he wanted from a nearby corner store .
Boone - Doty is accused of shooting Tyshawn multiple times in the alley — striking the boy in his head , back , right forearm and right hand .

Several witnesses identified Boone - Doty , Corey Morgan and Edwards as the men fleeing the scene shortly after the slaying .

After the shooting , the three men bought cleaning supplies and tried to clean the inside and outside of Edwards ' black SUV , Santini said .
The men reset the vehicle 's GPS and abandoned the SUV , prosecutors noted , but police were able to recover GPS data .

In March , Tyshwan 's father was charged with attempted murder in the shooting of three people , including Corey Morgan 's girlfriend and two of the woman 's nephews .

Tyshawn 's father , 25-year - old Pierre Stokes , is charged with attempted murder .

Prosecutors have described the shooting as one of the latest in the " ongoing gang war " that killed Tyshawn .

Stokes allegedly said , " I 'm going to kill you , b---- , " before opening fire in an Auburn Gresham parking lot on March 8 .
The attack happened a half - mile from where Tyshawn was killed in what police have called a " hateful act of treachery . "
