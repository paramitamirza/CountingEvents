 The father of one of two young women shot to death at a Halloween party in upstate New York over the weekend fought back tears as he condemned the violence that has long plagued his Orange County city .

" This is Newburgh , everybody fires a gun , " Miguel Cruz said Sunday , hours after his 20-year - old daughter Tabitha was gunned down at an apartment party along with 18-year - old Omani Free .
" They do n't believe in nothing .
This is a place where dreams die .
And my dream just died . "

Tabitha Cruz and Free were standing near the DJ booth at the party when gunfire erupted around 1 a.m. Sunday .
Five other people were wounded in the shooting , but they were all expected to survive .
Police said some sort of dispute broke out shortly before the shooting .

Authorities said that they are looking for 17-year - old Nija A. Johnson of Newburgh in the case .
He 's wanted on murder charges .

Two of the shooting 's survivors , Odalis Lugo and Gelissa Watson , told NBC 4 New York that people were fighting before the shooting .
Watson said that as soon as shots rang out Free , her cousin , was on top of her .

I grabbed her started walking to the door and i just heard gunshots and i just started ducking , " she said .
" I looked next to me and my cousin was on my legs next to me barely moving , she was trying to hold me , I could n't move my arm . "

Watson -- who said that the party was only the second time she 'd ever gone out -- was hit twice in the arm in the gunfire .
Lugo , meanwhile was grazed .

" I 'm going to have holes in my arm for the rest of my life , I guess , " she said .
" The doctor says I 'm lucky because it did n't hit a nerve . "

Two men , 21-year - old Rainier Hamilton and 20-year - old Tyson Oliveira , were arrested hours later on charges of tampering with physical evidence .
Hamilton is also charged with criminal possession of a weapon .
Both men were arraigned Monday in city court and ordered held on $ 50,000 bail .
Their assigned lawyers could n't be reached for comment .

Free was a high school senior at Newburgh Free Academy and had made a last - minute decision to go to the party , about five blocks from her home , with a friend , said her mother , Rhonda Valentine - Free .

Valentine - Free said she had left home to go to her own social engagement and did n't know her daughter had decided to go to the party .
She said she and her husband first got word that something had happened when a friend of their 15-year - old son who had been at the party called to say their daughter had been shot .
She said they went to a hospital , where their daughter died hours later .

" She was a sweet girl , " Valentine - Free said .
" She was my chocolate baby . "

She said her daughter had gone to a party in another section of the building before without incident .

Students at Newburgh Free Academy joined others in the community Monday to remember the two women , one of whom was a senior at the school .
