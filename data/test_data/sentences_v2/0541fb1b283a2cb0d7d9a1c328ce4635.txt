Brady Osborne given 36 months probation
MORRISON â€“ Rock Falls teen Brady Osborne received 3 years ' probation Thursday afternoon for accidentally shooting and killing his best friend 18 months ago .

" I am sorry , " the tearful Osborne said before the ruling .
" My stupid decision is the reason why my best friend is not here . "

He could have been detained in a juvenile facility until he turned 21 in the death of Matt Anderson .

The 17-year - old Newman Central Catholic High School student , son of State Police trooper Troy Osborne , also must complete 480 hours of public service , which will include publicly sharing his story , and must submit a letter of apology to Anderson 's family within 2 weeks .

" Brady is someone with low risk and high need , " Whiteside County Judge John Hauptman said before sentencing . "
He has a low risk of being a re - offender , and he has to deal with the psychological effects of the tragic lapse in judgment . "

Osborne must also continue to see Ronelle Allen , his Dixon - based therapist .
Allen told the court that Obsorne is suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder .
 "
He is forced to live and walk around with the memory that will not go away , " she said .
" He has a hard time sleeping , and he has nightmares over what happened . "

Allen also said Osborne must continue to live with his decisions .

" Going through the guilt and the grief is intense , " she said .
" He has to carry that guilt for the rest of his life . "

In other terms of his probation , Osborne will not be able to leave the state , unless he has approval from his probation officer .
He ca n't possess a firearm , and any weapon in his house must be locked and away from his possession .

He also ca n't consume alcohol or illegal drugs .

" If you violate the terms of your probation , I can re - sentence you , " Hauptman told Osborne .
" We could be right back in here . "

Osborne was charged with reckless conduct for accidentally shooting Anderson , 15 , in the chest on March 1 , 2014 , while handling a gun at the Obsorne home .

Assistant State 's Attorney Carol Linkowski had originally asked Hauptman to sentence Osbourne to juvenile detention .
 "
He went into his father 's closet to look for an air pump to play basketball , and he found the gun , " Linkowski said .
" He could have just left the gun on the shelf . "

The last person to speak before the judge gave his ruling , Osborne looked at Anderson 's family and told them how sorry he is .

" Matt is gone because of me , " Osborne said .
" I love you all , and I am sorry . "

The teenager 's words were met with tears from the Anderson and Osborne families .

Jennifer Anderson , Matt 's mother , tearfully addressed the court .

" This has effected our family in so many ways , " she said .
" Since Matt 's death , our world has been turned upside down . "

She said her son will not be able to experience life 's moments , like driving a car .

" Matt was really looking forward to driving a car , " she said .
" He will never drive , go to prom , graduate high school , graduate college , or have kids .
He will never have that chance , since Brady picked up a loaded gun . "
