Penn Hills man held for court in fatal shooting of motorcyclist
A Penn Hills man charged with fatally shooting a motorcycle rider and wounding five of his companions in August following an argument outside a Strip District bar was held for trial today during a preliminary hearing in City Court .

Kenneth Harrison , 41 , is charged with homicide , conspiracy and five counts each of attempted homicide and aggravated assault in the death of Tyrone " Easy " Tomman , 40 , of Penn Hills and the injuries to his friends .

District Judge Robert Ravenstahl decided in the prosecution 's favor despite the fact that two witnesses on the scene the night of the shooting testified they did not see Harrison fire a weapon .

Rather the men — Roy Sparrow and Clay McCoy — testified that shots came from inside the vehicle driven by Harrison as well as from another car .

Additionally , Mr. Sparrow said , there was a third shooter on foot .

" I would argue that there 's some real problems here with the Commonwealth , " defense attorney Ralph Karsh said . "
Mr. McCoy 's testimony has everyone with a firearm except my client . "

In response , Assistant District Attorney Phillip Hong - Barco tacked on the conspiracy charge .
He alleged that Harrison was a " getaway driver " and bore " accomplice liability " for the actions of three unidentified shooters .

The incident occurred Aug. 2 around 1:18 a.m. outside Art 's Tavern in the 2800 block of Penn Avenue .

It began when Harrison became agitated at Tomman and his companions — some of them members of the Pittsburgh Gentlemen Motorcycle Club based in Homewood — for the noise made by their motorcycles and how they were " taking up all the sidewalk , " according to a police affidavit .

One of the motorcycle riders told Harrison that " they were old men with grandkids and not looking for a fight . "

But Harrison did not settle down and , according to the police account , fired at the group from inside a sport utility vehicle .

Tomman was pronounced dead at the scene .

At least 20 people filled the courtroom Downtown for the 90-minute hearing including members of Tomman 's family and male and female riders wearing patches from at least three different motorcycle clubs .
