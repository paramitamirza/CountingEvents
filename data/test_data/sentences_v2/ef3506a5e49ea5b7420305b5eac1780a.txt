That ’s
all I heard was gunfire and the crowd turned around and was saying ‘ no , go back , go back , go back
they’re shooting.’ I never looked back after that , I just took off running .
”

Johnson wasn’t quick enough .
The 22-year - old was shot in her right leg .

I’ve been shot but I just have to keep going.’ ”

Neighbors said there ’s never been an issue there before .

It wasn’t missed on her that she and he were shot by the same man .

From the same gun , the same bullets took somebody ’s life , ” she said .
I’m leaving here alive , so emotions are just crazy because , like I said , I’m a single mother of four so instantly I think about my babies and … ( feel ) relieved that I could come home to them and I’m alive .
