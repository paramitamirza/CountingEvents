BALTIMORE ( WJZ ) —
Police are searching for information about a lone gunman who they say shot five people in broad daylight .
The violence follows another multiple shooting days earlier .

Christie Ileto has more on the investigation .

Police have no suspect and no clear motive but believe at least one of the five were targeted .
Now they’re hunting who pulled the trigger .

Innocent eyes and a maze of yellow tape after gun violence hit Penrose and Payton .

“ I heard the continuous bam bam bam bam , ” said resident Sylvia Roy .

A flurry of emergency calls followed .

Five were shot in broad daylight ; the youngest was 17 .
Detectives say at least one was targeted .

A lone gunman came around the corner , fired a number of shots at the individuals and then took off on foot , ” said Lt .
TJ Smith .

“ I see him grab his stomach and go to the ground , ” said one witness .

He didn’t want his face on camera but tells WJZ he witnessed the aftermath .
 “
He was just hollering , ` When is the ambulance going to get here ?
When is the ambulance going to get here ? ' ” he said .

The shooting happened just up the corner , literally a block away from an elementary school that had recently dismissed students .

It ’s frightening and it ’s around the time kids are coming home from school , ” said one neighbor .

And it ’s becoming too common , residents say .

Tuesday ’s violence comes four days after a handful of people were shot in a city strip mall parking lot .

It ’s sad .
I’m tired of hearing about it , for real , ” said one resident .
