New Year 's Eve shooting raises questions about city crime
NEW ORLEANS - “ I’m sitting downstairs and I’m thinking , those aren’t firecrackers , those are guns going off , ” said one man who heard the shooting .

In New Orleans , flying bullets welcomed 2016 .
Around 9:00pm , a New Year ’s Eve party on Amelia Street ended in gunfire .

I remember thinking to myself , watch , something is going to happen , ” said Henry Nuss .
Sure enough , I hate to be right about that .
The shooting got too close for comfort for longtime resident , Archie Tate .
His truck , now riddled with bullet markings , found itself in the middle of the gunfight .

“ I wasn’t expecting there’d be a shooting , ” he said .
But it wasn’t a surprise because we’ve had shootings in this block before .
New Orleans Police say five people were shot .
One man is in critical condition , while three of the other four were in serious condition .
The other person , who arrived much later , suffered a non - life - threatening injury to his leg .

Those who live nearby say these type of situations have to stop .

I know there ’s crime everywhere in the United States , ” said Nuss .
But it does seem to be an issue here in New Orleans , especially with the murder rates . ”
 “
It ’s just too many killings here , ” said Shawn Cole .
And it ’s for really no reason .
Crime stats for 2015 , in the city of New Orleans , show 165 people were murdered .
It ’s about a 10 % increase from the year before .

It ’s actually gotten to a point where it ’s normal , ” said one resident .
It ’s unfortunate .
People want change , and some say it starts with the New Orleans Police Department .

Everyone has the same question , ” said Nuss .
Where are you guys ?
We don’t see you anywhere ! ”

New Orleans Police Superintendent , Michael Harrison , met with the media Thursday to discuss the 2015 murder rates , and their plan for the new year .

Our goal for 2016 is to make sure we reduce crime , ” Harrison said .
“ We want to make the city safe and we want to make people feel safe and feel good about the police department and the officers who serve them .
Their strategy is more officers patrolling the city ’s streets .
 “
We’re doing everything we can , as a city and as a police department , to make sure that we double - down on all of our efforts , ” said Harrison .
Right now , we’re creating smart deployment strategies to put more cops on the streets and as many places as we can .
To be highly visible and to be preventive .
”
 More details on their plan will be released soon .

“ It ’s a little premature to say it right now , but it ’s about smart deployment , ” Harrison told the media .

Whatever the plan may be , residents just hope it’ll work .
 “
I hope the crime situation in New Orleans gets better , ” said Nuss .
I mean this is my home
, I 've lived here the majority of my life and I love it here .
There 's no place like New Orleans and it 's a shame we have to deal with this crime issue .
”
 “
It ’s just sad , ” said Cole .
“ Things just need to get a lot better here and people need to get together and stick together . ”
