FLORIDA CITY ( CBSMiami )
–
Miami - Dade Police have made an arrest in the shooting death of a Florida City boy .

Darin Booker , 13 , was killed Sunday night just blocks from his home .

Police said charges against a suspect were pending Monday night , but did not release that person ’s name .

There ’s a lot that I need to know , a lot that I need to know , ” said Helen Booker , the victim ’s grandmother .

Booker told CBS4 ’s Peter D’Oench , “
I loved him .
That ’s my only son ’s son .
Of course Iove him .
We all know he wasn’t a perfect kid but he was a loveable kid .
Both sides know that .
Booker ’s mother had hoped to speak to reporters outside the family ’s Florida City home .
But when D’Oench asked her if there was anything she would like to say about her son , she answered “
no ” and then broke down in tears and had to be escorted by loved ones into her home .

It happened around 9:20 p.m. at 425 NW 13th Street .

Witnesses told police a large group of family and friends were talking in front of the home at that address when a 15-year old brought out a gun he said wasn’t loaded .
While showing it off , he fired three times at his friends .

The gun , however , was loaded and the third time he pulled the trigger a bullet fired and struck and killed 13-year old Darin Booker .

 Bookers friend , Ashley Kendall , who was across the street at the time of the shooting believes it was accidental .

They was playing with the gun and just trying to see like the parts of it and he was trying to take the bullets out but he left one in .
He pointed it at him and he shot it .
Nothing happened .
Shot it again , nothing happened .
The third time the boy got shot in the chest , ” said Ashley Kendall .
“ I’m very sad .
I watched him die .
It hurt my heart .
”
 “
They say this man pulled his gun and shot two times , two times and nothing came out , ” said Helen Booker .
That ’s murder .
That ’s murder .
The 3rd bullet came out after he pulled it .
Booker ’s aunt , Michelle Jackson , said , “
This is very painful , very painful .
I helped raise Darin as a child .
I just want to get to the bottom of this and hope that justice will play out .
Kiana Simmons , a friend of Booker , said she was in the house when she heard the shot .

“ I came outside and it was like , no , my cousin came inside and said ‘ oh , somebody is shot , somebody is shot’ he told momma .
We came outside and Darin he hit , he hit the gate and fell and he was like taking his last breath .
I was just crying cause that was hurtful , like we used to play together and we knew each other .
We used to play football , basketball and today we were playing football in the park , ” said Simmons .

Viola Knight was one of the first adults to reach the scene of the shooting .

“ All the kids went running by , wild and screaming , they went and got his mother from around the corner .
It ’s just sad , it ’s a sad tragedy , ” said Knight .

Booker ’s cousin , Thomas Daniels , doesn’t believe the shooting was an accident .

It wasn’t that , the whole neighborhood knows , everybody seen that it went , they knew that gun was loaded , ” said Daniels .

Daniels said his cousin and two of the teens involved were friends who had recently had a falling out .
Daniels believes his cousin was murdered .

They was his friends at one time
but I guess he did something to them and they didn’t like him no more
and they did that to him , ” said Daniels .

Booker was a seventh grader at Redlands Middle School .
Friends said he loved to laugh and play football .

His sister , Keke Anderson , said “ It just doesn’t seem right .
To think he was having a beef with those teenagers and we didn’t know about .
He didn’t know if would mean so much trouble otherwise he wouldn’t be around them .
We just want to know what happened and why it happened .
”
 A vigil in Darin ’s memory is planned for Thursday at 7 pm at the scene of the shooting .
