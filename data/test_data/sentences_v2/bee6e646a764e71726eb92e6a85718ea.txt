 Detectives in Humble are investigating a shooting that sent four children to the hospital .

The shooting happened shortly after 6 p.m. Monday in the 2100 block of Grand Linden Court .

The wounded children 's ages were 6 , 11 , 15 and 16 , officials said .

They were taken by ambulance to the Texas Medical Center for treatment .

Their injuries were not expected to be life - threatening , Harris County Sheriff 's officials said .

The shooting may have been the result of a fight between more than a dozen teenagers , authorities said late Monday .

Harris County sheriff 's deputies at the scene did n't know if the shooting was the result of gang activity .

Deputies said the two younger children were " innocent bystanders . "

Sheriff 's deputies took nine people into custody to question them about what happened at the scene .

The gun used in the shooting had not been found later Monday .

The children all live in the neighborhood .
Sheriff 's officials said there have been past shootings in the general area but not at the location where the children were wounded .

Deputies are trying to locate shell casings so they can determine what weapon was used in the shooting .

The darkness and a Monday rainstorm that pounded the neighborhood made the task of gathering evidence difficult , officials said .

The search is expected to resume at first light , officials said .

The identities of the wounded children have not been released .
