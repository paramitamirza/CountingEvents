Fired Grand Rapids clerk Lauri Parks suing city for $ 1 billion , document shows
GRAND RAPIDS , MI -- Lauri Parks , fired from her job as Grand Rapids city clerk in 2013 , has filed a $ 1 billion job discrimination lawsuit against the city , according to a document filed Monday , Dec. 15 , in U.S. District Court .

A docket for the civil case shows Parks is suing Mayor George Heartwell and the city in federal court , and she is representing herself .
Further information about the case has not been filed .

Parks , who was appointed to the job in 2008 , was fired in October 2013 after city commissioners voted in a special meeting performance review not to renew her one - year contract and to place her on paid administrative leave for three months .
They said Parks ' dismissal was prompted by years of negative job performance feedback and that she failed to make improvements in teamwork , judgment and leadership .

She was offered the option to either resign quietly with six monthsâ€™ pay or take another city job .
Parks left during the closed - session performance review .
Her annual salary was about $ 95,000 .

Some black community members stood behind Parks and publicly expressed outrage and disappointment at the City Commission 's decision .
An attorney for Parks at the time alleged discrimination and contended there was no basis for the firing .

Heartwell told the city 's Community Relations Commission , which investigates complaints of discrimination , that " at no time was Ms. Parks ' race or gender a factor in the commission 's decision . "

Parks is the granddaughter of Grand Rapids ' first African - American mayor , the late Rev. Lyman S. Parks .
She could not be immediately reached for comment Monday night .

Steve Guitar , communications director for Grand Rapids , declined comment Monday because city leaders have not received a copy of the complaint .
