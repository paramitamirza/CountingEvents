Victim ’s family wants owner of shotgun prosecuted in accidental shooting
PUYALLUP —
The accidental shooting that killed 13-year - old Eddie Holmes now has the boy ’s family pleading with lawmakers to make a change .

His parents also want the owners of the gun to be prosecuted .

The Holmes family spoke to the media at the Puyallup Police Department Tuesday morning .
And while they don’t blame the boy who accidentally shot their child –
they believe his parents , the owners of the shotgun , should be prosecuted .
 “
Those were Eddie ’s friends , ” said a sobbing Sandra Aponte Holmes , Eddie ’s mother .
My heart does go out to them , but Eddie ’s not here . ”

An emotional Holmes family still struggles to cope with the loss Eddie .

My brother , he was a good kid , ” said Eddie ’s older brother , Jose Holmes .
Great personality that everybody could love .
”

The shooting happened last week inside a home on 11th Street in Puyallup .
Five boys were inside when one of them pulled out his stepfather ’s shotgun from behind a bedroom headboard .

One of the boys pumped the shotgun – and it fired directly into Eddie ’s chest , killing him .

Police call the shooting an accident but the shooter was arrested and faced a judge last Friday .
The 13-year - old suspect was released from juvenile detention on Tuesday while prosecutors continued looking at all the evidence in the case .

Eddie ’s family says the shotgun owner should have made sure the gun couldn’t fall into a child ’s hands .

Because our state has yet to agree on locking and securing guns , I’m left with the unbearable task of planning the funeral of my 13-year - old son , ” said Sandra .

Prosecutors say the shooter ’s parents could face charges but so far none have been filed .

“ It is my hope that speaking out today motivates just one person to secure their gun , my son Eddie Zee Holmes’ life would not have been taken in vain , ” said Sandra .

She hopes gun owners across Washington state will take better care to store and secure their firearms .

As only a mother whose child has been killed by gun violence can know , this pain that I am feeling is so unbearable , ” said Sandra .

Eddie ’s funeral is Saturday at New Tacoma Cemetery at 1 p.m.
The family says the public is invited to attend .
