Whataburger Survives PR Nightmare After Worker Denies Service to Police
A Whataburger worker in Lewisville , Texas was fired for refusing to serve two off - duty police officers , creating a public relations nightmare for the company and raising interesting questions about how to handle rogue employees .
The fast food joint came under fire on Twitter after news of the employee ’s refusal to serve the officers circulated . EMPTY
Whataburger immediately responded on social media .

“ We would never condone this action and this is completely unacceptable .
We are working hard to address this as soon as possible . ”
Indeed , by this morning at 9 AM the business tweeted that the employee was off the payroll and that the two officers who were refused service have been asked back so that Whataburger can “ make this right .
”

Good Cop , Bad Cop

The officers’ mixed responses , however , show how difficult it will be for the company to correct the perception — EMPTY created by a single employee acting independently — that Whataburger is anti - police .

Officer Michael Magovern told Fox4 News that he still loves Whataburger and doesn’t want to throw the company “ under the bus ” ( although he gladly enjoyed a meal at Dairy Queen after the incident ) .
He believes this is a problem with one location or one employee , and in his thirty years serving the public as a firefighter and police officer , “ this is the first time this has ever happened to me .
”
 Magovern thought the man behind the Whataburger counter was joking when he said , “ We don’t serve police officers . ”
But Officer Cameron Beckham was less inclined to take the incident in stride , saying , “
It really strikes a nerve personally and professionally because maybe he ’s joking or maybe he ’s not , but how do we trust that individual or that company to cook anyone ’s food now ? ”

We , the Tweeple
 People on twitter responded more positively , however , with many showing their support for the burger company and lauding its quick response on social media .
ME Harpahl wrote , “
@Whataburger Awesome job !
Will take the family to my local Whataburger today to honor a great Texas company !
Thank you Whataburger ! ”

Still , not everyone was pleased and some tweeted that Whataburger was not doing enough .
The company is sticking to its story , however , repeating the phrases “ apologize ” and “ make it right ” in most of its exchanges .

How to Handle Rogue Employees

So what should you do if you find yourself in Whataburger ’s very awkward position , with your hard work and stellar reputation sullied by the carelessness of a single employee ?
Follow the fast food company ’s lead .

First , be careful what you tweet .
People will demand engagement , statements , and explanations .
Do apologize but do not say anything certain until you have a plan for finding out what happened .
Make sure the company ’s response is unified , consistent , and coming from an appropriate person .

Try not to get caught up in the urgency of the moment .
Even an emergency PR situation benefits from a little planning — you may not have much time to mull it over , but do carefully consider your words before speaking as you may risk more blunders .
And what a bummer that would be .
