 Detroit â€”
A shooting at a block party on the city 's west side Saturday night left nine injured and one dead , according to police .

The shooting happened on a basketball court during a children 's party near Dexter and Tuxedo just before 9 p.m. , police said .

" It 's a miracle that not one kid is shot , " Assistant Police Chief Steve Dolunt told Fox2 .

" I do n't know what the hell these people were thinking with this many kids out here .
I 'm livid .
There 's no excuse for this , " Dolunt said .

Dolunt said a 20-year - old man was killed .
He was not being identified while relatives were informed .

Another man was critically injured and eight others , five men and three women , were listed as seriously injured .
The victims ranged in age from 21 to 46 , he said .

Dolunt said the shooting happened at a neighborhood party that included a barbecue attended by families with some small children in strollers .

Dolunt said police do not yet know the reason for the shooting .

Anyone with information should call Detroit Police at ( 313 ) 596 - 1616 .

The shooting comes one day after the kickoff of an initiative aimed at stemming violence in the city and providing resources .

The " Occupy the Corner " effort , spearheaded by District 5 City Councilwoman Mary Sheffield , is modeled after a project Sheffield observed last year while in New York .

The occupy program links residents with job training and health care services , utility and housing assistance , and legal help with clearing criminal records in an effort to address the root causes of violence in the city .

It was first deployed late last fall in a handful of neighborhoods within Sheffield 's district .

Earlier in the week , the Detroit City Council rejected a citywide , four - day curfew during this weekend 's River Days festivities and the fireworks display on Monday in downtown along the Detroit River .

On Tuesday , after several hours of emotionally charged statements from citizens and civil rights advocates , the council voted 4 - 3 to reject a plan by Detroit Police Chief James Craig to impose the four - day curfew that would have required anyone 17 or younger visiting downtown from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Friday through Monday to be accompanied by an adult .

The proposal riled civil liberties advocates , raised racial concerns and frustrated some council members who argued it came too late and coincided with the National Baptist Convention at Cobo Center that 's expected to draw thousands .

The council , however , did narrowly favor a curfew for the annual fireworks show on Monday that will run from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. and be limited to the downtown area .
The boundaries include the Detroit River to the south , I-375 to the north , Chene to the east and the Lodge Freeway to the west .
Jones and Sheffield turned it down .
