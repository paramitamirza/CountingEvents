 MEMPHIS , Tenn. —
After a violent weekend in Memphis , police are investigating four separate shootings that left 10 people shot and one stabbed .

These shootings happened all over the city .

The most recent shooting happened at an apartment complex near Horn Lake and West Mitchell Roads .

A cap laid in the grass for hours , right next to a marker where police found a bullet .
Feet away , another marker sat next to the 20th bullet officers found .
But neighbors said they heard way more than that .

“ I heard rounds of bullets , " said one neighbor , who did not want to be identified .
" Thirty to 40 shots , like assault rifle sounds .
”

Five people were shot and one was killed at the Richmond Place Apartments early Sunday morning .
Bullets flew as children slept in their beds .

“
My son 's window got shot out upstairs , ” neighbor Ladesa Millbrooks said .

Luckily her son was not in his room that night ; Millbrooks said she is thankful he was at his grandmother 's house .

But that ’s the only thing that made Millbrooks smile .

While police scoured her neighborhood , Millbrooks fought back tears .
She told WREG the victim killed was sleeping in a car , waiting on friends when he was struck by a bullet .
 “
He will never wake up again , " Millbrooks said .
" That ’s what ’s got my heart .
That could have been my son . "
 “
I’m confused , I worked so hard , ” said Frank Gottie , who grew up in the neighborhood .

Memphians normally see Gottie at anti - violence events .
But this weekend , his message of peace hit hard when he received a call that two of his cousins were shot at the apartment complex .

“
It makes me feel like I got to push harder and harder .
I got to get out here with this bullhorn , ” Gottie said .

Neighbors said the complex ’s security gate hasn’t worked in quite some time .
They said they are hoping something is done soon to keep families living here a little more protected .

One victim remains in extremely critical condition ; three others are expected to be okay .

Police have not released any suspect information or said what led up to the shooting .
