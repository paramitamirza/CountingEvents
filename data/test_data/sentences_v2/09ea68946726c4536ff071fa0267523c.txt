House fire in Maywood Park , Portland
At 01:37 Monday , EMPTY Portland Fire & Rescue was dispatched to a reported house fire at 9914 NE Failing St. Initial reports also stated that the occupant might still be inside .
On arrival fire crews found a house with heavy smoke and fire showing from most of the windows .

As the first companies entered the house they found access difficult due to the fact that the house had excessive content clutter .
Once entry was made firefighters needed three hose lines to slow the fire enough to search for the possible victim .
Approximately ten minutes into the fire police ( who were on scene ) reported that the occupant had made contact with them and was safe .

At this point the roof of the house began to weaken .
This posed an extreme danger to firefighters operating in the interior of the residence .
With the confirmation that all of the homes occupants were safe fire command ordered all firefighters out of the structure and the switch was made to defensive ( exterior ) firefighting operations .

One firefighter suffered heat exhaustion and was transported to Portland Adventist Hospital as a precaution .
He was released within hours and is expected to fully recover .
The homeowner who discovered and attempted to extinguish the fire was later transported to the hospital for a physical evaluation .

The cause of the fire is undetermined at this point and investigators will likely be working on scene throughout the day .
