MOUNT VERNON , N.Y. ( AP ) -
In a story Dec. 25 about a nightclub shooting in Mount Vernon , New York , The Associated Press , relying on information provided by the mayor 's office , reported erroneously on how many people were killed .
One person died in the shooting , not two .

The AP , also based on information from the mayor 's office , also misspelled the victim 's first name .
He is O'Neil Bandoo , not O'Neal .

A corrected version of the story is below :
 1 killed , 5 wounded in suburban NYC nightclub shooting
 Police have arrested a man they say opened fire on a packed suburban New York City nightclub , killing one man and wounding five others
 MOUNT VERNON , N.Y. ( AP ) -
Police have arrested a man they say opened fire on a packed suburban New York City nightclub , killing one person and wounding five others .

Authorities say the suspect may have been ejected from the Mansion nightclub in Mount Vernon shortly before the 4:26 a.m. shooting on Christmas Day .

Mount Vernon Mayor Richard Thomas said in a statement Sunday that the establishment 's owner , O'Neil Bandoo , was killed .

The mayor 's office says an initial report that a second victim had died was incorrect .
The mayor says that person is recovering after extensive surgery at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx .

Police say the shooting victims were found in the lobby and on the street outside the club .

Officials did n't immediately name the suspect , but say he is a Bronx resident with a pending attempted murder case .

Witness Cleveland Douse tells The Journal News that 200 people were in the club during the shooting .
