Teen fatally shot in head in southwest Macon
A 16-year - old former Southwest High School student died from a gunshot wound to the head early Tuesday morning off Nisbet Drive .

The Bibb County Sheriffs Office got the call of a shooting shortly before 4:30 a.m. after receiving an earlier call about shots fired .

Bibb County Deputy Coroner Lonnie Miley said Antrez Felder died inside a home at 308 Bobby Jones Lane , which is close to the cul de sac not far from the corner of Bobby Jones Street .

Felder was wounded in the head , but it did not initially appear to be a suicide , Miley said .
He said it might have been an accidental shooting .

It was not immediately clear , either , whether he was shot multiple times , but an autopsy is expected Wednesday morning .

It is just a tragic situation that we have a young person who has been killed this morning, Miley said Tuesday .

Witnesses at the house reported hearing gunfire .

Not multiple shots , from what I understand , there was just one shot heard, said Lt .
Randy Gonzalez , a public information officer for the Bibb County Sheriffs Office .
Were not ruling anything out right now .
Investigators are still talking with witnesses .
When you have a situation like this , you look at all avenues.
 A Bibb County crime scene technician gathered evidence inside the house , which was roped off with yellow tape .

Coroner Leon Jones said Felder was pronounced dead about 4:45 a.m.

The Southwest High School principal was notified about the death , according to officers at the scene .
Bibb County schools spokeswoman Stephanie Hartley said Felder had attended Southwest High but was not enrolled there this year .

About 6:20 a.m. , students in Felders neighborhood emerged from homes to head to the bus stop on Nisbet Drive .

One girl with tears welling in her eyes clutched a binder as the students silently walked up the street .

When asked if the teens knew Antrez , one of the young men nodded , but they were too upset to talk about what happened .

Counselors are available at the high school for any students who want to discuss their feelings about Felders death , Hartley said .

He was a mannerable boy, said Felders aunt , Stephine Colson .

She said he hoped to go into the military .

He was trying to finish school, Colson said .
He was good in school .
He didnt act up.
 Felder , known to friends as GQ, enjoyed making people laugh all the time, Colson said .
He had plenty of friends .
...
What happened really was an accident.
