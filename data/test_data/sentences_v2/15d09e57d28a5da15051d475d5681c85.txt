 HENRY COUNTY , Ind. ( Aug. 28 , 2015 ) –
Officials in Henry County are investigating after three bodies were found in a home just east of Knightstown Thursday morning .

Officers were first called to the home in the 5500 block of West Old National Road to conduct a welfare check after one of the children in the home had not shown up to school .
That ’s when investigators found the bodies of two children and one adult male .

On Friday , Henry County Prosecutor Joe Bergacs confirmed the two children died of gunshot wounds , and the father died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound .

According to Henry County Prosecutor Joe Bergacs , a deputy looked through a window and observed a young boy on the floor .
Deputies forced entry into the house and determined the 5-year - old boy was deceased .
Upon a search of the home , deputies found an 11-year - old girl , who was also deceased .
The children 's father , 48-year - old Joseph Horn , was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound .

Court records show Horn 's wife filed for divorce on August 11 .

Prosecutor Bergacs said there is no evidence a suspect is at large .
The horrific discovery has left neighbors in the small community absolutely stunned .

This just does not happen in this area whatsoever .
It ’s just unreal , ” said neighbor Sheila Rawlins .

Shelia owns the land right across the street from the home .

She says the family , a man and woman and two kids , had moved into the home earlier this year .

Sheriff ’s deputies won’t confirm the ages of the people found inside the house , nor would they say exactly how the victims died .

Investigators did say the bodies were found throughout the house .

Neighbors are heartbroken to think children may have lost their lives .

It ’s unbelievable , ” said Rawlins .
I can’t believe someone would do that to two kids .
”
 “
It ’s disturbing and it ’s sad , ” said neighbor Janine Mattix .
The kids didn’t ask for that . ”

Janine says the homeowner claimed to be retired military , spent most of his days at home and always walked around with a gun on his hip .

Neighbors also tell us the couple had been going through some domestic issues and wouldn’t be surprised if a fractured relationship led to the deaths .

“ I wasn’t real conformable around the man .
I didn’t get a good vibe off him .
If he ’s responsible , it doesn’t really surprise me , ” said Mattix .

It ’s too bad the kids were the victims .
It ’s a sad thing that they had to pay the price , ” said neighbor Ross Manche .
