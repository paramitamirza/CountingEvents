 A drive - by mass shooting Friday that left two men dead and two others wounded on the city ’s west side could have been even more tragic , a Detroit police official said .

There was a 4-year - old and 10-month - old outside playing right there , and these clowns come by shooting guns , ”
Assistant Police Chief Steve Dolunt said .
“ I’m livid .
 “
I’m thinking this had to be retribution for something .
These are all older guys .
”

The first victim , identified as in his 60s , died hours before the second , a 43-year - old man , Detroit Police Officer Jennifer Moreno said .
The two survivors , whose conditions at local hospitals were unknown , also are in their 40s and 60s , she said .

Their relationship wasn’t immediately clear .

The shooting happened at about 3:40 p.m. at a home in the 2600 block of Hazelwood near Linwood .
The victims were on the porch when three men in a black Dodge Journey SUV opened fire .

There were two types of weapons used : A pistol and a long gun , ”
Dolunt said .

Dolunt said he didn’t believe the first man slain was the intended target .

It ’s still early , and I could be wrong , but that ’s what it looks like , ” he said .

Witnesses did not provide a full description of the shooters , Dolunt said .

The shooting unnerved neighbors and others on the street , which is lined with mostly two - story homes .

It ’s shocking , ” said Renee Little , whose family lives nearby .
It ’s daylight .
”

Kiara Head was down the street with her children and preparing to pick up another when she heard multiple shots .

She eventually learned her friendly neighbor had died .

He had a heart so big , ” she said .
 “
He helped me carry groceries , played with my kids , loved them as if they were his own grandkids .
He ’s going to be missed . ”

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers of Michigan at ( 800 ) 773 - 2587 .
