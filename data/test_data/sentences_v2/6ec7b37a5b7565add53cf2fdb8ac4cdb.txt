 Multiple shots rang out Wednesday afternoon near Jeremiah E. Burke High School on Washington Street , and some students said the gunfire occurred after a fire alarm went off inside the school .

Boston police said a 17-year - old male was found dead at the scene .

Three others , including two teenage boys and a 67-year - old woman were also injured , but their injuries are not described as life - threatening .

Witnesses said they saw one of the victims running from the scene after shots were fired .

" When a 17-year - old dies on the street , coming out of school , then we all should be outraged , and shame on anybody who does not step up and help us out with this , " Evans said .
" I 'm calling on the community to step up and help us identify the individual who did this . "

This is Boston 's 13th homicide this year .

" The victim is too young to be gunned down in the middle of the street , " Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said .

The victim has not been identified , but friends said he was a junior at the school and enjoyed making videos with his friends and posting them to YouTube .

" He 's a nice kid .
He gets good grades .
Everyone he hangs out with gets good grades .
So I 'm not understanding , " Victoria Johnson said .
" I do n't know .
I do n't know what he was doing outside of school , but in school he was focused . "

Evans , at a news conference Wednesday afternoon , said the public should be outraged .

" When a young kid , he looks to be about 17 , gets shot , we need the public to be outraged , " he said .
" There are way too many guns on the streets .
Way too many guns in the hands of young kids .
We need everyone 's help to get the guns off the street . "

Burke and nearby Dearborn STEM Academy and Lilla G. Frederick Pilot Middle School were placed into safe mode after the shooting , but that was lifted around 2:15 p.m.
 Police are continuing to search for the shooter , and anyone with information about the incident should call police immediately .
