9-year - old girl shot in drive - by while sleeping on couch at friend 's home
ORLANDO , Fla. - A 9-year - old girl was shot early Tuesday while sleeping on a couch at a family friend 's home in Orlando , according to deputies .

At least 30 rounds from three guns were fired from a car into the home in the 1300 block of 22nd Street , Orange County sheriff 's deputies said .
The homeowner fired six shots in return , according to deputies .

The girl was shot in the leg by gunfire from the assailants and was taken to a hospital , according to deputies .
She will spend the night in the hospital , but she is in stable condition .
The girl 's 5-year - old brother and four adults were also inside the home at the time of the
 shooting , but no one else was injured .

"
This happened in darkness .
Obviously , we 're gravely concerned about this level of violence in this neighborhood , " Orange County sheriff 's spokeswoman Jane Watrel said .
" I believe the homeowner was acting in protection .
So , at this point , the homeowner is cooperating . "

" It 's senseless , man .
Senseless , " neighbor Charles Howard said .
" It 's sad that it 's a 9-year - old victim involved in this . "

Howard said it 's not a bad neighborhood .

" It 's just some guys that make it bad for the rest of us , " he said .

" I 've seen the hookers get picked up in my front yard , drug deals going down in my front yard and across the street , " said Bonnie Hyberger , a neighbor who 's lived behind the home that was targeted for 15 years .
" No one cares , no one is doing anything . "

A large portion of 22nd Street was blocked off as detectives interviewed witnesses and processed the crime scene , which was littered with numerous shell casings and evidence markers .

Deputies said there 's no information about the shooters .

"
No one saw them , so we 're going to have to assume that people came in a car , got out and opened fire , " Watrel said .

An investigation is continuing .

It 's not over , " said Hyberger .
" It 's not over back here .
These people can not even stay here tonight .
They ca n't stay in that house , same thing 's gonna happen again . "

The children 's mother was out of town when the shooting occurred but returned to be with her daughter , deputies said .

Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Crimeline at 800 - 423-TIPS.
