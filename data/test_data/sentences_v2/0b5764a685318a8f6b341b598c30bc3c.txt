 Newly - released video shows the alleged groping by a former TSA screener that led to a scandal at Denver International Airport , reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave .

An airport security camera footage obtained by CBS Denver station KCNC captured the controversial pat - downs .

Footage from the morning of Feb. 9 shows former TSA workers Ty Spicha , 27 , patting down travelers the Colorado airport , while Yasmeen Shafi , 22 , operated the scanner .

According to one TSA employee who reported the pair , Shafi would manipulate the scanning machine to identify males Spicha found attractive as female .
That would trigger the machine to detect an anomaly in the passenger 's genital area and permit Spicha to perform a pat - down .

Three months after that tip , the TSA began an investigation and eventually fired the pair .

The Denver airport refused to release the video to CBS Denver for months , citing an ongoing criminal investigation .

Shafi admitted to participating in the plot , saying it involved at least 10 passengers .

The TSA called the incidents " shocking and egregious . "
The agency has not been able to confirm potential victims and no criminal charges have been filed against Shafi or Spicha .
