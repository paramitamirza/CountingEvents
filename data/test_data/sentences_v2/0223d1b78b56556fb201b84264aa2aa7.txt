Judge denies bond for Atlanta teen accused of shooting 5 - WMC Action News 5 - Memphis , Tennessee
A teen accused of shooting five people near a southwest Atlanta high school was denied bond during a court appearance on Wednesday .

The public defender for Marcellus Brooks , 17 , said the teen is in school and employed and asked the judge to put him on house arrest .
The judge refused and sent Brooks back to jail .

Police said Brooks started shooting at an intersection near Therrell High School where a large group of students had gathered Tuesday afternoon .

One of those shot was in critical condition Wednesday afternoon .
The other four are expected to recover .

CBS46 talked with one of the teens injured , 17-year - old Trevion Morgan , who was just released from the hospital .

" I thought I was probably going to die , " said Morgan , pointing to the bandages , where the bullet missed his heart by inches .

Morgan said a group of students met near the school after classes let out to see two girls who were supposed to fight .
The fight never happened and shots suddenly rang out .

" As soon as I heard the gunshot , I looked and I felt it
and then I started running . "

Morgan 's mother said she was at work when she got the call her son had been injured .

" Please do n't let my baby die , " Keshia Hurston recalled saying to herself as she raced to the hospital .
" I 've been up all night , thanking God he 's still here . "

Atlanta police said they continue to investigate the motive for the shooting .
Sgt .
Greg Lyon said they have reports there was some type of argument just prior to the shots being fired .

The Atlanta School District said the shooting did not occur on school property , but they have increased security as a precaution .

" We have been working with the Atlanta Police Department , with our security department to make sure that our students and our staff are safe , " said Steve Smith , the district 's associate superintendent .
" We want to have as close to a normal day as possible . "

Records show MARTA police arrested Brooks in March on robbery charges .
He posted bond and was released last month .

The teen remains locked up at the Fulton County Jail .
He is due back in court on May 28 .
