SAN BERNARDINO >
> Juan Gomez has seen a lot of violence in his young 28 years — including what he saw during his tours in Iraq .

But with the 28th homicide this year in the city on Monday night , the violence he ’s seeing in San Bernardino is beginning to draw troubling parallels .
 “
This place is bad , ” he said Tuesday , a day after right across the street 24-year - old Orlando Wayne Hunt Jr. of Beaumont died from multiple gunshot wounds in front of the ND Vape shop at 312 E. Base Line .

It ’s so violent you don’t even feel safe in your own home , ” Gomez said .
“ I was safer in Iraq than I am here .
It ’s time to rethink my options and get out of Dodge .
”

The shooting , which also seriously injured four others , took place shortly after 11 p.m. , police Lt .
Rich Lawhead said .

The smoke shop is in a small strip mall on the corner of Base Line and Waterman Avenue , police said .
Hunt was found on the sidewalk in front of the business .

Three of the victims were found inside the smoke shop and the other was found behind the smoke shop near Stater Bros. Market , police said .

Authorities believe he collapsed running away from the shooting .

Three employees of the smoke shop were inside the business as the barrage of gunfire found its way inside the shop , but they took cover when bullets began to fly and were unharmed , police at the scene said .

Police believe the motive behind the shooting was gang and/or drug - related .
Authorities are searching for two men they believe are suspected of shooting the five people .

Like Gomez , residents of the neighboring Waterman Gardens housing project say they heard the shots ring out .

“ I was sitting in front of my home when it sounded like I was back in Iraq , ” Gomez said .
It just sounded like the gunfire wouldn’t stop .
I ran into my home .
”

After the shooting , more than 20 yellow markers were placed throughout the parking lot of the strip mall showing where bullet casings landed after being ejected by a handgun .

 Police responded to a shooting in the same area just the night before .

Shortly after 11 p.m. , 9 - 1 - 1 received multiple - shots - fired calls from a Jack in the Box restaurant at 303 East Base Line , saying men were shooting at each other .
One group was firing their guns from Masters Donuts at 306 East Base Line toward the Jack in the Box and the other from the Jack in the Box toward the doughnut shop , police said .

Nobody was hurt in that shooting .

“ I watched these knuckleheads shooting at each other from across the street Sunday , ” 87-year - old San Bernardino resident Michael Johnson said .
This has to be a retaliation from that . ”

However , even though residents of Waterman Gardens believe the two shootings are related , police say no .

There is no evidence that the two shooting are related , ”
police Sgt .
Gary Robertson said .

Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Detective Bill Flesher at 909 - 384 - 5655 or Sgt .
Gary Robertson at 909 - 841 - 5361 .
