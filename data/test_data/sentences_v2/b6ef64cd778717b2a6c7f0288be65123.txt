The gun violence that has plagued parts of Minneapolis this year struck again over the weekend as at least 13 people were shot , one fatally , in separate incidents across the city , according to police and scanner reports .

As homicide detectives continued Monday to investigate the slaying of 28-year - old Jaquan Oatis in the North Side ’s Jordan neighborhood late Friday , officers also searched for clues in the shooting of five people early Sunday morning .

The five victims — three men , ages 21 , 21 and 20 , and two women , ages 51 and 21 — were shot at the Plymouth Avenue Townhomes in the 1700 block of Plymouth Avenue N. , police said .

None suffered life - threatening injuries .

According to scanner traffic , witnesses reported seeing a suspect — described as a man with a thin build , buzz haircut and wearing a white T - shirt — fleeing westbound on Plymouth moments after gunfire erupted .

Officers on the scene told dispatchers that the “ mouth of the alley ” behind the complex was littered with spent 9mm and .45-caliber shell casings .

Between Friday morning and Sunday night , at least seven other people were shot across the city .

A 27-year - old Minneapolis man who walked into the emergency room at Hennepin County Medical Center and told police that he had been shot in south Minneapolis .
The man later changed his story and said the shooting took place near Lyndale and 40th avenues N. He admitted that he had lied to officers about the location and that he had given them a phony name because he had two outstanding warrants .
