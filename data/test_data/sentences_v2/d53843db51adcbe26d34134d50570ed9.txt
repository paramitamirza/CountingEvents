Tacarra Morgan , 6 , Shot In Englewood , Is Expected To Recover , Police Say
HYDE PARK —
The 6-year - old girl caught in an Englewood shoot out Tuesday is out of surgery and expected to survive , police officials said .

At 1 p.m. , Tacarra Morgan was shot in her stomach in the 6000 block of South Paulina Street , said Officer Nicole Trainor , a Chicago Police spokeswoman , citing preliminary information .

The girl was taken to Comer Children 's Hospital , Trainor said .
She underwent surgery Tuesday afternoon and is " expected to recover , " Deputy Superintendent John Escalante said at Far North Side community meeting Tuesday .

Escalante said this type of crime frustrates police , and said he had to compose himself at the scene before talking with media .

" Every child has a right to play on their porch in the summer , " he said .

A group of 20 - 30 family members , including her parents , were gathered at the hospital anxiously awaiting for Tacarra to get out of surgery , activist Andrew Holmes said Tuesday evening .

Holmes said he had been communicating with Tacarra 's grandmother .

" They are worried about the child right now , " Holmes said .
" They are really frustrated and praying for the baby .
I can see the frustration in them and on their faces . "

The family is " hoping for the best outcome they can get and also some answers from Chicago Police , but most of all the answers from the community on who may know who these individuals are who discharged the weapon , " Holmes said outside the hospital .

The girl had been sitting on the front porch of her home when shots erupted , Holmes said , adding that there were about 20 shell cases on the ground .

" Some of the bullets pierced the houses , the windows within a two - block radius , " he said .
" This bullet hit the baby while she was on the porch with family . "

Holmes said no one else was hit as far as he knows and that police are still there working the scene .

" There may be some gang conflict , but definitely an altercation between two groups , " Holmes said .
" I will leave that up to the police department to determine . "

Morgan was in " critical but stable " condition after surgery , said Anthony Guglielmi , a Chicago Police spokesman , in a tweet .
Her condition is being monitored " very closely . "

A witness to the shooting posted the aftermath live on Facebook .

In a video posted to Facebook , a man showed the aftermath of the shooting : A man cradled the girl , her arm wrapped around his back , as police and witnesses walked and talked around the two .
Children came over to the girl 's side and looked at her .

" This the s--- we got to deal with around here , man , " the man taking the video said .
" This the type of s--- we dealing with around here every day , man . "

The shooters hit everyone but the person they 're aiming for , the man taking the video said .
He called the shooters " cowards . "

" The only person you all hit is a little girl , man , " the man said .
" They 're shooting innocent girls .
It 's what they do .
They shoot little kids , man . "

Police put up tape and pushed back onlookers in the man 's video , but he swept his camera over the street , saying there had been 40 or 50 shots and shells were all over the road .
Nearby , two people imitated the sound of the gunfire : " pow , pow , pow , pow , pow , pow ... . "

" All these shells just in the street , " the man said .
"
And only one bullet hit one person : a little girl .
...
I 'm praying to God right now this little girl OK.
 " This little girl was just sitting on her porch , playing by herself , when a bullet meant for somebody else just hit her . "

The man said nearby homes had also been hit by gunfire , breaking windows .

" This what Chicago done came down to , " the man said .

A man who lives in the block said he was in his car when two white vans driving in opposite directions on Paulina opened fire .

He said he heard about 80 shots .
Other witnesses confirmed the number of shots .

" I was about to get out of my car but I ducked , " said the man , who asked to remain anonymous .

" Those kids were out there playing , " he said .
" It do n't make no sense . "

Michelle Thompson stood on the taped off street Tuesday afternoon .
She ran out to the scene because her daughter and grandchildren live on the block .
She said they were n't hurt and she does n't know the girl who was shot .

" Somebody 's child , " she said as she began to cry .
" Kids ca n't come out to play .
It 's so sad the way we have to live . "

James Greenlee lives right in front of where the shooting happened .
He went out to run an errand and came home to find gunshots in his front window .

" I went to get my prescription and came back and saw all the police , " he said .
" I said , ' who messed up my blinds ? ' I know my dog did n't do it . "

A bullet ricocheted through his living room and hit the wall above his couch where his fiancée normally sits , Greenlee said .

" This is crazy .
A lot of families live on this block , " Greenlee said .
" I 'm getting out .
I do n't do nothing but go to work and come home . "

Police in a statement Tuesday evening said Superintendent Eddie Johnson , who is in Washington D.C. , has been in regular communication with Deputy Superintendent Escalante and Chief of Detectives Gene Roy regarding Tuesday 's shooting .
Police said Johnson " has directed all resources within the Bureau of Detectives and Bureau of Patrol be dedicated to gathering community intelligence in the case . "

" The level of gun violence on the south and west sides of our city is absolutely unacceptable , and it ’s appalling when our children are caught in the crossfire of individuals who have no regard for human life , " Johnson said in the statement .
"
To safeguard our neighborhoods and our children , it is imperative that we establish a culture of accountability for repeat gun offenders in Chicago and hold them responsible for senseless gun crime . "

Police also will be hosting an " Operation Wake - Up " Wednesday at 8 a.m. at 60th & Paulina to " mobilize the community and our partners in taking a stand against gun violence and helping detectives generate community intelligence to find who is responsible , " police said .

Police had no further information on the shooter or girl 's condition Tuesday afternoon .
