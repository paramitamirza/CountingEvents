 HENRY COUNTY , Ind. ( WISH ) —
A man and his two kids were found dead inside of their home in Henry County on Thursday morning .

It happened in the 5500 block of West Old National Road in Raysville near Knightstown .

The Henry County Prosecutor identified the man as Joseph Horn , 48 .

Deputies with the Henry County Sheriff ’s Department did a welfare check after neighbors said the kids never showed up for school .

Crime scene tape blocked off what used to be the home of Joseph Horn .
Deputies said the 48-year - old man died from an apparent gunshot wound .

This is such a strange incident .
It ’s just unusual for something like this to happen around a nice town , ” said neighbor Ross Manche .

Deputies said they arrived on scene before 9:00 a.m. and could see a little boy through the window , but once inside they realized the boy was dead .

Deputies searched the home , also finding his 11-year - old sister lifeless .

There ’s just no feeling to explain how bad the situation like this is for the kids and all the families involved , ” said Manche .
It ’s bad for their relatives and everybody left has to live with it .
”
 Detectives spent hours gathering evidence inside of the two - story home .

A man living across the street said Horn ’s family moved in a couple of months ago .

I think they just wanted to get out of Indianapolis .
They were looking for a nice , big , old home and that fits the bill , ” said Mattix .

Mattix said he heard from a friend that the couple was going through a divorce .

According to court records , Joseph Horn and his wife had a court hearing Wednesday .

I met him one time for 20 minutes .
He came over and stood in my kitchen and talked and introduced himself that ’s about it , came over with his little boy , ” said Mattix .

Deputies have not said how the children died or where everyone was found inside .

Investigators do not believe anyone else was connected to this crime .
