Man kills brother , 2 others in Kensington
Police responded to the triple homicide on Westmoreland Street after receiving a report of gunshots around 3:45 a.m.

A 46-year - old man shot and killed his brother and two others inside a Kensington rowhouse early Sunday morning , then barricaded himself inside until he was coaxed to surrender by a 911 operator he had called , according to police .

The gunman , whom police did not identify on Sunday , allegedly killed his brother , his brother 's girlfriend , and an unrelated third man with a shotgun inside the house on the 600 block of Westmoreland Street .
A fourth person was also shot , police said , but survived and escaped with non - life - threatening injuries .

Police released no motive for the crime , and did not identify the gunman or any of the victims .
The shooting occurred during a violent weekend in Philadelphia : Authorities said four people were killed - including a 4-year - old girl - and seven injured in shootings across the city Saturday and Sunday .

Police responded to the triple homicide on Westmoreland Street after receiving a report of gunshots around 3:45 a.m.

When they arrived , the man inside the house refused to open the door and began yelling at officers , authorities said , telling them he had a shotgun , that he had shot someone , and that he would not come outside .

The man then called 911 , apparently because he did n't believe that the uniformed officers in front of the house were police , Chief Inspector Joe Sullivan said Sunday .

Over the course of the next hour , Sullivan said , the dispatcher kept him on the phone in an effort to get the man to surrender .

The SWAT team , meanwhile , also went to the scene .
When SWAT officers climbed onto the roof of the house , the gunman fired a shot toward a skylight , Sullivan said .
No one was hit , and police did not return fire .

Around 5 a.m. , Sullivan said , the dispatcher 's convincing apparently worked - the man walked outside and was placed in custody .

" They were able to convince him that it was the police [ outside ] and he did surrender , " Sullivan said .

Officers who went into the house after the arrest found a gruesome scene :
A man was in the living room with " massive head injuries " from a shotgun blast , police said , and another man and a woman were found face - down on the dining room floor with shotgun wounds to the head .

A fourth victim , who survived , was found earlier by police a few blocks away .
He was taken to Temple University Hospital to be treated for his injuries , police said .

Charges against the alleged shooter were still pending on Sunday afternoon , said Sgt .
Eric Gripp , police spokesman .
