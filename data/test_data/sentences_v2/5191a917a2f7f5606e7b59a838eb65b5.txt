BALTIMORE ( WJZ ) —
The investigation continues into who shot seven people in West Baltimore , killing a 15-year - old boy .

Rochelle Ritchie has emotional reaction from neighbors .

That 15-year - old who was shot and killed would have been going to school Monday .
But instead , his family is planning to bury him .

Baltimore City streets are filled with gunfire as police investigate another shooting .
This one–injuring six and killing another– happened Saturday night in the 1500-block of W. Fayette Street .

“ I think to hear seven people shot in a cluster is outrageous for this city .
And it ’s unacceptable for us as a whole , ” said Commissioner Anthony Batts , Baltimore City Police .

Deshaun Jones–just 15 years - old and set to start at Frederick Douglass High School this week — was shot and killed .

“ I seen him laying there fighting for his life , ” a woman said .

Balloons and a stuffed animal are now left to show condolences for the life lost .
Those living across the street are still overwhelmed with emotion .

Police believe the shooting started over an illegal game of dice .

“
He was a young child .
Nobody ’s life deserves to be taken , ” a woman said .

There are no confirmed reports that Jones was part of the game , or the intended target .
 “
Some of the other six victims , non - fatal victims , have had police histories .
They have come in contact with us at different times .
We know at least one of the victims has been shot prior , ” Batts said .

The violence that has triggered across West Baltimore has residents sick to their stomachs .
They’re begging the criminals to put the guns down .

Shootings in Baltimore have seen a frightening increase into the double digits .
The extra police officers on the streets are not enough to bring comfort to those in the middle of a war zone .

“
Everybody just needs to get together .
Police , everybody , ” a woman said .

Just this week , Baltimore City Police added an extra 150 officers to the streets .

No arrests have been made in the shooting .
