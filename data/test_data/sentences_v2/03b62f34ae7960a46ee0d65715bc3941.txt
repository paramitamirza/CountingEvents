Metro police : 1 suspect dead , 3 arrested amid stolen car investigation
NASHVILLE , Tenn. –
One suspect is dead and three others are in custody amid a stolen car investigation in Nashville .

The situation unfolded Friday afternoon in Antioch around the South Shore neighborhood off Hamilton Church Road , not too far from the La Vergne city line .

Metro police spokesman Don Aaron said the incident actually began two days ago when a woman left her keys and purse inside her Oldsmobile on Meridian Street in East Nashville .

The woman worked with her dealership to track the GPS signal to Sunset Drive near Hart Lane .
Police said the woman found her car , saw it was empty , and went to have an extra key made , but when she arrived the second time , her car was gone .

Metro - Nashville police were called on Thursday and an investigation began .

The car ’s GPS was tracked again Friday , and both K-9 officers and a helicopter were used to pinpoint the location .

According to Aaron , the Oldsmobile was found driving down Oceanfront Circle in the South Shore neighborhood as a police cruiser was driving up the same street .

The Oldsmobile collided with the driver ’s side of the police cruiser , pinning the officer inside .
Four people inside the Oldsmobile then bailed out of the passenger ’s side and took off running .

Aaron reported a K-9 officer spotted two of the suspects run into nearby woods a short time later .

The officer let his K-9 go after the suspects and one shot as heard .
Once police got to the scene , one suspect was captured by the K-9 while another was found dead .

Aaron said the suspect was either shot by his accomplice or himself ; two guns were found on the ground , and no Metro police officer ever fired a weapon .

A third suspect was also caught by the K-9 about eight - tenths of a mile away , while the fourth was located inside a shed back near the homes in South Shore in the area of Beachfront Avenue and Oceanfront Circle .

None of the suspects’ identities have been released at this time .

The investigation is ongoing .

Aaron said police still need to determine who shot the suspect that was killed in the woods—himself or an accomplice .

He also said two bullet holes were found on the top of Oldsmobile , “ strongly suggesting ” one of the suspects got out of the vehicle and fired two shots toward the police car .

“
The bullet holes are angled in such a way that they are facing toward the police car , ” Aaron explained .
“
The shots were fired in that direction . ”
