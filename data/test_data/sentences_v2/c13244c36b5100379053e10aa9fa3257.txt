After teen accidentally shoots himself with rifle , family has me - | WBTV Charlotte
Michael Parsons was always careful around guns .
The 17-year - old , who was going to be a senior at Crest High School in Shelby when school starts in a few weeks , was an avid shooter and hunter who went to as many safety classes as he could .

But an accident turned tragedy Saturday afternoon .
While Parsons was cleaning his hunting rifle , he accidentally shot himself and died .

" We were robbed of an amazing person , " said Myrtle Parsons , Michael 's mother .

Parsons ' family told WBTV Michael loved comic books and cartoons , was always happy and telling jokes , and wanted to be a welder when he graduated from high school .
He was a straight - A student .

But the most important thing to him was his family .
 "
He would just randomly walk up to me and just hug me and tell me , ' dad I love you . '
And it 's the same with his mother , out of the blue , for no reason at all .
He 'll walk up to you , tell you he loved you and wrap his arms around you , " said David Parsons , Michael 's father .

As Michael 's family continues to mourn , they have a message for families with guns : be careful .

This tragedy has not changed their view on guns , but they want to make sure other families do n't go through what they have over the past few days .

" Believe me , you do n't want to do this .
This is unbearable , " David Parsons said .

Michael 's family said he was always safe and responsible around guns .
They said they want families to know one accident has turned their world upside down .
