A 24-year - old Sun Valley woman was fatally shot after a hike in Tarzana in which the suspect was allegedly testing his handgun , authorities said Monday .

Heriberto Gonzalez , 20 , of Reseda was set to be booked on suspicion of murder in the death of Angela Hernandez , according to the Los Angeles Police Department .

“ We’re looking for any witnesses to come forward , ” Detective Manuel Armijo said in a telephone interview .
“ We don’t think he went out there to kill anyone else .
We’re looking to see if any outstanding witnesses at the hiking trail might have seen or heard anything .
”

At 3:40 p.m. Sunday , authorities said , LAPD West Valley Area patrol officers responded to a radio call of a homicide at Northridge Hospital Medical Center .

When officers arrived , they found Hernandez with a single gunshot wound .
She died from the injury .

Investigators allege that at 3:15 p.m. Sunday , Hernandez and Gonzalez , along with two other people , drove to the south end of Vanalden Avenue in Tarzana .

The occupants then left the vehicle and hiked up a dirt trail , authorities allege , to test fire Gonzalez ’s handgun .
When they returned to the car , Gonzalez shot Hernandez , police said .

Detective Armijo said there was no dispute before the incident but he could not give more details about what may have led to the shooting .

“
They went out there to go fire a handgun .
It was a 9 millimeter .
That ’s all we have , ” Armijo said .

Hernandez was struck in the torso “ from side to side , ” the detective explained .

Gonzalez and Hernandez knew each other from work .

“
She met the suspect at a job where they formally worked together , ”
Armijo said .

The two were friendly but were not dating , he added .

After the shooting , Hernandez ’s friends drove her to the hospital , where she later died .
