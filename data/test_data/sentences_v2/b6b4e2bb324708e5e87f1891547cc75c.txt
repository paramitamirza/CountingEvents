The full family statement from Go Fund Me is below :

On Thursday November 10th , despite his parents ' best intentions , 4-year - old Micah Zahringer found a firearm , presumed to be unloaded and shot himself in their home .
He suffered major head trauma and was taken by ambulance to Aspirus Langlade Hospital .
From there he was air lifted to St. Joseph 's Children 's Hospital in Marshfield and was immediately taken into surgery .
The doctors told the family that he may not make it through the surgery but by God 's grace he did .
After surgery they were told he had lost a lot of blood and has extensive damage to the right side of his brain , and he would likely need at least 2 more surgeries .

He is in the Pediatric ICU and is sedated to keep him from moving , so as not to further his injuries .
Micah 's vitals have been recently steady , which is really good news .
The doctor is planning to do a CT scan , but is waiting to let Micah rest unless they see something that they can not explain .

Antigo Police said crews were called to the scene on November 10 at 6:20 p.m.

Authorities said they are treating the incident as an accidental shooting .
