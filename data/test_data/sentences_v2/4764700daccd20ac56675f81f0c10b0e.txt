According to Columbus Police , an Upper Arlington teenager was shot to death inside her boyfriend ’s home in south Columbus Tuesday night .

17-year - old Daylee Newman was staying with 18-year old Thomas P. Gutierrez on Markison Avenue , according to family members .

Gutierrez ’s brother , Andre Mehler , said his brother had dated Newman for seven months and the shooting was an accident .

" They loved each other .
He would not do this on purpose , ” Mehler said .

He said he was with them in an upstairs bedroom when the gun went off .

“ I told him to put it away and stop playing with it .
I get up to go…and I turned around and right before I turned around I hear a boom , ” he said .

That boom was a single gunshot that struck Newman .

Mehler said Gutierrez was putting in the clip in and out of the gun when it fired .

“ [ The gun ] has a hair trigger on it .
So if you touch it lightly , it 's going to go off , ” Mehler said .

The frantic call to dispatchers came from Gutierrez .

Dispatcher :
Did you see who shot her ?
Caller :
Yeah , it was me .
We were playing with the gun .
We were playing with a gun , ma'am .
Babe , wake up .
Dispatcher : Where is she shot ?
Caller :
In the arm or in the chest , I do n't know .
Please help me , please .

Police have charged Gutierrez with murder .

Meanwhile , Mehler said he wants people to know his brother is not a killer .

“ I know it was accidental , I was right there , ” he said .
“ It was not on purpose . "

Gutierrez ’s father said his son has no criminal record and was two credits away from graduating from South High School .

On Thursday , a judge set his bond at $ 1 million .

Newman attended Upper Arlington High School until her junior year .
The school said grievance counselors will be at the school Thursday and Friday .
