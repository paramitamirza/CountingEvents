Man with assault rifle , body armor shot by Vallejo PD officers
Vallejo police on Monday released more details on what they are calling an " attempted assassination " of two officers who were on a coffee break Sunday night .

Investigators said police shot the suspect , identified as Adam Powell , 41 , of Suisun City .
They said he was armed with an assault - type gun and body armor .

Police also revealed that Powell is the father of a 2-year - old child in Suisun City who was critically injured when the toddler accidently shot himself in the chest earlier on Sunday .

The child was rushed to the hospital in critical condition .
The boy was alone in the room , which led authorities to believe this was an accidental shooting .

Before officers arrived at that scene they say a person of interest fled the home .

The boy ’s sister , 19-year - old Breauna Bowers , spoke with KTVU by phone on Monday .
She identified her brother as Adonis Powell and said the boy is in critical , but stable condition at UCSF Benioff Children ’s Hospital Oakland .
Bowers was not home at the time of the shooting and said she did not know a gun was inside the house .

" He was bleeding like hell and I wrapped him up and carried him down the stairs , " said the boy 's grandfather , who gave his name as Willie .
" I looked around and he was gone , " described Willie , who described his daughter as having a four - year relationship with Powell .
The couple has two children .
Adonis has a twin sister .

" He 's my youngest grandson , my boy , adorable , he 's adorable , " said the upset grandpa .

Bowers said she personally believes the boy ’s father , Adam Powell , left the house and wanted to hurt himself because he was in pain over the accidental shooting .
She said Powell is a good father and respectful to the family .
She said he is not the kind of man who would point a gun at officers , as he is accused of doing to two officers in Vallejo Sunday evening .

“
I just think he was in shock and he didn’t know what else to do , ” Bowers said .

On Sunday , at about 8:50 p.m. Vallejo police officers were inside a Starbucks at 199 Lincoln Road West when a man opened the door to the business and pointed an assault - type gun at the officers .
Police said the gun had a high - capacity drum .

Security footage provided to KTVU by a gas station across the street , shows the suspect walking through the parking lot up the the Starbucks before turning around and running away .

Officers said the man was manipulating the gun as if it malfunctioned .

The officers drew their guns and the suspect ran through a parking lot and then west on Magazine Street , police said .

The officers caught up with the man at Magazine and Sheridan streets and he continued to manipulate the gun .

Police said the man posed a deadly threat to officers and they shot him .
The man suffered three gunshot wounds before he fell .

He was taken to a hospital with life - threatening injuries , according to police .

Neither officer was injured .

In a statement , police said the incident " underscores the extreme danger that police officers face on a daily basis .
More importantly it demonstrates the bravery and courage of our officers who place themselves in harm 's way to protect our communities . "

" There is little doubt that if it were not for the decisive action of our two officers that today 's story would be much different . " police said .
