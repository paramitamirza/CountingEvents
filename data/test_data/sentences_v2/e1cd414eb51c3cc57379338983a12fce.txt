The small community of Exeter is grieving after the death of a teenager who was shot during a hunting expedition Sunday morning .

Luke Burns , 16 , an Exeter Union High School student , was hunting with family and friends just before 8 a.m. near Horse Meadow when he wandered in front of hunters .
He was hidden behind some brush when another hunter fired and struck the boy in the torso .

Family and friends tried to give CPR and first aid , later rushing the boy to the California Hot Springs Ranger station , where he died .

Luke is a twin .
He is survived by his brother Levi .

Detectives from the Sheriff ’s Departments Violent Crimes Unit were called to investigate the shooting , which they called an accident .

The Sheriff ’s Department is using the incident to bring words of caution to hunters .
 “
The Sheriff ’s Department would like to take this time to remind hunters during this hunting season to practice good firearm safety measures , ” according to a statement . “
Know the direction you are shooting , what you are shooting at and what your shooting backstop is .
”

Exeter Union Principal Robert Mayo said he called a special assembly this morning to notify students and offer counseling .
At the end of the assembly , Mayo gave students an extra 40 minutes to talk amongst each other and mourn the loss of their classmate , whose twin also attends Exeter Union .

Many of the students are using on - campus grief counselors .

“ We are a family .
They deserved to know .
There was shock and sadness , ” Mayo said .
“
I told them to lean on each other and find strength in one another .
”

Luke is the third Exeter Union student to have died in the past two years .
He was described as an avid member of the school ’s ag department .
 “
He was a nice , young man , ”
Mayo said .

The Department of Fish and Game have yet to return calls for comment .
They’re assisting in the investigation .
