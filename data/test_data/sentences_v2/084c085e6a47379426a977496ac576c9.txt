Neighbor of child who was shot appears in court
Bond was set Friday at $ 75,000 on the neighbor of the 2-year - old who died of a gunshot wound last Saturday .

Sidney Davis , 44 , of Denmark was formally charged with possession of a weapon by a felon , possession of a stolen weapon , possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia .

“
I’m going to set bond at $ 75,000 in the matter , ” said Craig Threatt , Bamberg County ’s chief magistrate .

Threatt further ordered that when Davis obtains an attorney , he is to maintain contact with his legal counsel and also remain in the state .

The Denmark man said little during the brief hearing other than to answer the court ’s questions .
For the most part , he sat with his head held down .

Davis has not been charged in connection with last Saturday ’s shooting death of Hayden Mayes .
The 2-year - old toddler died from a single gunshot wound to the chest he received at Davis’ home .

The State Law Enforcement Division investigation into the child ’s death is ongoing .

Family members of the child said it was not uncommon for Hayden and others to play at Davis’ residence , which is about 100 feet from the Mayes home .
They said Davis enjoyed having the children at his home .

Judy Prophet , Hayden ’s great - grandmother , said earlier she believed the shooting was a tragic accident .

Davis’ criminal history in Bamberg County shows the Mill Street man was sentenced to seven years concurrently on charges of first - degree burglary and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature in 2000 .

In August 2000 , drug charges against him were dropped .
Another pair of drug charges against Davis were dropped in 1994 after it was determined the state ’s key witness was not reliable , court records show .
