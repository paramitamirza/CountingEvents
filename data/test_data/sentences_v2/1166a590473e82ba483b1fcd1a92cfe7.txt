The man has not been identified , but according to the Phoenix Fire Department , he was a gun dealer who loaded black powder ammunition as a hobby .

In the simplest terms , loading ammunition involves priming a cartridge case , adding a powder charge to the case and then seating a bullet on that charge .
The victim reportedly used black powder , which is an easy - to - ignite mixture of sulfur , charcoal and saltpeter , rather than the more powerful smokeless powder used in most modern guns and rifles .

While it 's not clear what sparked the fire , there are inherent dangers in loading or reloading ammunition , particularly when it comes to storing the components .
 "
[ G]reat care must be taken when handling black powder .
Things such as static electricity can ignite it , " explained StarlineBrass.com in an article comparing the black powder and smokeless powder .

The presence of the ammunition and loading components made the fire even more dangerous .

" There 's thousands of rounds of ammo in there .
We do n't know how many went off , but it was intense to get in there and put that fire out , " Ardell Deliz of the Phoenix Fire Department said .

The first - alarm fire started just after 1:30 p.m. Friday .
It took crews about 30 minutes to get a handle on it , but hot spots continued to smolder more than two hours later .
The first - alarm assignment means five engines , two ladder companies and four command officers were sent to the scene .

Jared Dillingham tweeted that the North Phoenix neighborhood had been sealed off .
Crews were keeping everyone a block away as a safety precaution .

The victim 's wife escaped without injury .
