Overloaded electrical circuit causes house fire
At 2:30 am EMPTY Wednesday , an overloaded electrical circuit caused a house fire at 6371 SW Childs Road .
Firefighters from Lake Oswego and Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue found the attic of this one story home engulfed in flames .
Soon after arrival , flames were coming through the roof .
Firefighters acted quickly and were able to extinguish the fire in about 30 minutes .

Investigators are saying too many space heaters plugged in overloaded the circuit and caused this fire .
The occupants of the house noticed that the lights were not working just before 2:30 AM.
When they went to investigate they started smelling smoke .
When the owner went to check the attic he found flames and tried to extinguish the fire with an extinguisher .
Due to the smoke he was unable to put the fire out and had to get out of the house .
All 5 occupants , Sandy Schroeder , Janet Alexander , 3 relatives and a family dog escaped without injuries .
The Red Cross is assisting the family at this time .
The owners did not have insurance and it most likely will be a while before repairs are made so they can move back in .

Firefighter initially had a problem with one fire hydrant that was not working .
It is unsure if the hydrant was turned off , or if it was frozen .
Another hydrant nearby was used quickly to establish a good water supply .

Damages to the house and contents are estimated about $ 60,000 .
