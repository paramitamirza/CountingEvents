CYPRESS , Texas –
Neighbors say a 4-year - old boy was spending the night at his grandparents’ home when he accidentally shot himself in the head overnight .

How did the boy get a hold of a gun ?
That ’s a question many people on Redbud Berry Way were asking in the hours after the child shot himself in the head early Tuesday .

“
Seems like that could’ve been avoided if it was put away properly , ” Vicki Seal , neighbor , said .

Deputies aren’t saying where the gun was being stored in the home , but they say the child gained access to the firearm sometime after midnight , while spending the night at his grandparents .

“ I’m just shocked my heart is pounding , ” Sylvia Chandler , neighbor , said .

Residents in this neighborhood less than a half mile away from the Premium Outlets say this boy a familiar face around here because he stays at his grandparents regularly .

“
He was actually playing with my son a couple days ago , very saddened by that , ”
Broderick Johnson , neighbor , said .

Investigators questioned those grandparents for hours after their wounded grandson was taken away by Life Flight in critical condition .

Just as authorities were about to clear the scene , the grandmother collapsed to the ground , visibly consumed with emotions .
 “
Praying for them , praying for the medical team to handle it with the utmost care , ” Greg Davis , neighbor , said .

While detectives did not take anybody in custody at the scene , the case isn’t closed .
It will now be up to a grand jury to decide if charges should be filed .
