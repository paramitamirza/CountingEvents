 TUCSON ( KGUN9-TV ) - Tucson police say five people died Tuesday night in an apparent murder - suicide .

Five people were found dead in a southside home Tuesday .
They are Raul Carrillo , 58 ; Karen Saari , 53 ; Erick Carrillo , 32 ; Christopher Carrillo , 25 ; and Isela Rodriguez , 17 .

Detectives say Christopher Carrillo shot and killed four of his family members before killing himself .

Police chief Roberto Villasenor said someone arrived at the home , in the 800 block of West Calle Medina Road , to meet a friend , but instead saw bodies and signs of violence through the window .

By Wednesday evening , clusters of candles and other remembrances marked the wall between the neighborhood and the house where so many died .

By phone , one of Raul Carillo 's daughters told KGUN9 Chris Carillo was troubled and withdrawn , and did get some mental health treatment
but she says no one thought he was dangerous .

She says the youngest victim , Isela Rodriguez is normally not at the house , but Chris Carillo convinced her to walk there with him , as if he wanted to gather as many family members as he could before the killing began .

But Daniel Ortega , who says he â€™s a friend of Chris Carillo saw no hint of trouble .

" Two days ago he was fine , " Ortega said .
"
He said hi to my brother and he was taking a walk and that 's it . "

The family dog is the only survivor from the house on Calle Medina as Pima Animal Services rescued him in the early afternoon .
If the family does n't claim him , he may be up for adoption .
