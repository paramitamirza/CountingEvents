 Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance says one of the two men sitting inside a black Honda Accord around 11 pm Tuesday night at Visions Sports Bar was likely the intended target of a retaliation shooting .

" The two shooters pulled up in a black Chevrolet Tahoe , got out , began to fire rounds into the Honda .
The other victims happened to get hit by random gunfire , " says Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance .

Both men inside the Honda were killed , and three others were injured when about 50 rounds were fired from two assault rifles and one handgun .
The weapons have not yet been recovered .

Authorities have now released the identities of the men killed in the shooting : 26-year - old Demarcus McElroy and 38-year - old Steve McElroy .

Chief Vance says , often the guns that fall into the hands of the wrong people are legal .
As long is a person is 18 years old , not a convicted felon , and the gun itself is legal , not much can be done .
He understands Jackson 's serious crime problem , and hopes to get to the root of it .

" It 's our hope that we can continue to build relationships in these neighborhoods , develop informants who may have knowledge of these beefs that are going on before they play out in such a tragic way so that perhaps we can intervene , " he says .
" We want to move forward , not stay the same .
We 're just asking for anybody , everybody 's help that agrees with that . "

No arrests have been made in the case .
