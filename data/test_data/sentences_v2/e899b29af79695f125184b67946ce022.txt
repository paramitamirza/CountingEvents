Police say they found a 5-year - old boy dead inside an apartment after a man involved in a 17-hour standoff surrendered on Friday morning .
Officers said the standoff with the unidentified man began at about 5:30 p.m. on Thursday at the Riverchase Apartments in the 7900 block of South Riverside Drive .
Bryon Creech , 36 , surrendered to police at about 10:30 a.m. on Friday .
Police entered the apartment and found the boy 's body inside .
Police said the boy was his son .
Creech has been booked into the Tulsa County Jail for first - degree murder , shooting with intent to kill , kidnapping , second - degree burglary and violating a protective order .
Police said the man came to the apartment where his wife and child live , violating a protective order .
They said the couple is going through a divorce but have joint custody of the child .
Late Friday afternoon , police said the woman left the apartment to go to work on Thursday , and some time after that , Creech came to her apartment and brought their son .
He had court - allowed visitation with the boy , police said .
Officers said Creech broke into the apartment and barricaded himself and the boy inside , but his wife was able to see him remotely through surveillance cameras she installed .
His wife called police to report Creech was inside her residence , and shortly after officers arrived , they said Creech fired at least 10 shots .
Police evacuated the complex and set up a secure area around the apartment where the man and the child were located .
Officers said the department 's special operations team talked with Creech by phone all night in an effort to get him to surrender .
Court documents show Creech 's wife filed a petition for a protective order in July 2014 after Creech threatened her with a gun .
The woman was afraid Creech would hurt her or her son , records say .
She also cited his size – Creech is 6-foot-6 and weighs 330 pounds , according to her petition .
 “
He is a very large angry loud man .
He blocked with his body in our bedroom and would not allow me to leave the bedroom .
Recently his anger has been escalating .
He constantly threatens and harasses me in a loud and frightening cruel way .
My son is afraid of him and has told me so .
The defendant has had anger management treatment before .
This spring during an argument while I was trying to leave he placed a hand gun on the couch between us .
I was frightened to leave because of his behavior and the gun .
He has taken my cell phone away in the past to prevent me from calling 911 .
He has also taken my car keys in order to trap me at the house .
I am very afraid of him and know that things will get really bad when I file for divorce .
He threatened “ to make my life a living hell ” if I filed .
I am afraid he will hurt me and my son .
His behavior is getting worse and out of control .
He has forced me to do things I did not want to do .

Creech also filed a petition seeking a protective order against his wife .
He wrote in the document that he found bruises on his son 's thigh and back in January .
He claimed the child said " mommy grabbed me and pushed me . "
Creech 's request for a protective order against the woman was denied .
He was booked into the Tulsa County Jail on Friday afternoon .
In November 2014 , Creech was charged with malicious injury to property , a misdemeanor .
According to court documents , Creech vandalized his wife 's vehicle during a meeting to exchange custody of the child .
QuikTrip surveillance footage caught Creech scraping something down the side of her vehicle , an affidavit says .
That case still is ongoing in Tulsa County District Court .
Tulsa Police Sergeant said the medical examiner has not released an official cause of death .
