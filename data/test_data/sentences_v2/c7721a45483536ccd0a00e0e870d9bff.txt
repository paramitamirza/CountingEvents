Not long after , police responded to Westmoreland Street near Tampa -- less than a block away -- for a shooting inside the house .
When officers arrived , they were able to talk with a man through the door , but he would n't let them inside , Sullivan said .
Police declared a barricade at 4:10 a.m. and called SWAT teams and hostage negotiators .

The man stayed in the house more than an hour and at one point fired several shots at SWAT officers from inside as they climbed onto a nearby roof , police said .

 Sullivan said at one point , the man called 9 - 1 - 1 and told a police supervisor on the phone that he was armed with a shotgun and at least one person was dead inside the house with him .

Hostage negotiators eventually stepped in , Sullivan said , and managed to convince the man to surrender .
He did so peacefully and was taken for questioning .

When police got into the house , they discovered a grisly scene : three people inside suffering from gunshot wounds .
One victim , a man , was found lying on the living room floor with an apparent shotgun wound to his head , police said .
Another man was found on the dining room floor also suffering an apparent shotgun wound to his head , and a woman was found lying on the kitchen floor with what appeared to be a shotgun wound to the head , according to police .

Police also found a gun inside the house .

" It 's a tragic scene , " Sullivan said early Sunday .

The chief added that preliminary information indicated that all four victims were injured in the same incident , and that it appears the man found first managed to escape from the gunman .
It 's unclear what led to the shooting or what the gunman 's relationship to the victims is .
He said the suspect is known to police .
