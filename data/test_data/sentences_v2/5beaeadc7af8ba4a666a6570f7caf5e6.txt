Father arrested after 11-year - old son accidentally shoots himself in the butt
( WXYZ ) - An 11-year - old boy is in the hospital after accidentally shooting himself Thursday morning .
It happened in an apartment at the corner of Vernor and Hubbard in southwest Detroit .

He was home alone , ” said Commander Whitney Walton .
His father had left early for work and what our information is , he told the son , there is a rifle in the house if anything happens .
The boy somehow found the loaded weapon .
According to police , he started playing with it and it went off .

The child was in the buttocks .
With no one phones in the home to call for help , he alerted his dad about the shooting through Facebook .

The son had a cell phone but apparently recently lost it , ” said Commander Walton .
I guess there was not a home phone for him to call his father so that was the only tool he had was social media to reach out to his father through instant message .
His dad immediately called 911 and returned home .
The boy was taken to the hospital where we are told he is in stable condition and walking .

“ I think leaving an 11-year - old with a loaded rifle is a reckless act , ” said Commander Walton .
I mean , you should not have an 11-year - old home alone with a rifle you have made them aware of .
I mean , you need to have your weapon secured , put somewhere .
Children are children .
They’re going be curious .
Police are still investigating to see how the child was able to shoot himself in the butt .

The child ’s father is cooperating with police .
Neighbors are relieved the child is okay .

I don’t know how he had access to the gun , ” said neighbor Alicia Dixon . “
But from what I see and what I know his father is a terrific dad .
I can tell by the way they interact with each other .
The father has been arrested and could face charges .
The case is being investigated by DPD ’s Child Abuse Unit and Child Protective Services .
