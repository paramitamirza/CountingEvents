PRENTISS , MS ( WDAM ) -

A Prentiss teacher has been fired after cameras were found in a restroom at J.E. Johnson Elementary School .

According to John Wayne Tolar of the Jeff Davis County Sheriff Department , Arthur Martin claimed that he put the camera in the bathroom at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday morning and it was found later that day at 1 p.m.
 Martin taught fifth grade , according to Tolar .

Martin has been charged with photographing and filming a subject without consent under the age of 16 , according to MBI officials .

According to MBI officials , investigators seized a computer and other technology from Martin 's Lamar County home .

Martin 's bond was set at $ 150,000 .

Jefferson Davis Superintendent of Education Will L. Russell released the following statement regarding the incident :
 " On September 23,2015 , a camera was found in one of the restrooms at J.E. Johnson Elementary School .
In our effort to promote safety for all students , the matter was immediately reported and placed under investigation .
There were no students injured or harmed from this incident .
After being turned over to authorities , the camera was determined to be one of the employees of the school .
In upholding the Mississippi Code of Ethics , this employee was terminated .
It is the goal of the district to ensure that all employees , students , staff , and any visitor on our campuses are safe . "

However , one parent , who did not want to be identified , said she was not notified by the school about the incident .

" My child comes home and tells me that there 's a video camera in the bathroom .
Like really ?
I do n't get a notification from any teachers .
I did n't get a note from either one of my kids , " the parent said .

She said she has two children in fifth grade , which is the same grade Martin was teaching .
 "
" Is my child on this video ?
I did n't get any type of anything .
We need to be aware of this .
We did n't have anything .
We 're only going by what other people are saying , and you ca n't listen to kids all the time , " the parent said .

Juanita Baggett is a grandmother of students at J.E. Johnson and had a similar experience .

" My grandson came home and was talking about that , " Baggett said .
" I was like ' what ?
What happened ? '
He told me ' granny I do n't really know , but all I know is that this is going on at the school . '
Why has n't the school called and let the parents know what 's going on ?
If it had been , you know , anything else they would have said something .
These are kids .
little innocent kids that have to go to school .
What if he would have went in the bathroom and actually attacked one of those kids ?
What were they going to do ?
Cover it up then and keep it ?
Something really needs to be done . "

" We really need answers about this , " the parent said .
