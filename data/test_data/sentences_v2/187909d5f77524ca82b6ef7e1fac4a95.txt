 Warning : The 911 call is very emotional and may be difficult for some to hear .

The 911 call made after a 3-year - old boy shot and killed himself has been released .

The shooting happened around 7 a.m. Tuesday at a home on Camp Circle in Dallas .

Holston Cole was taken to Paulding - Wellstar Hospital where he was pronounced dead .

Holston 's father , David Cole , can be heard yelling , “
No..No..get to my house please quick " to the 911 operator .
The call was very emotional .

In the 911 call , Cole said Holston got the gun out of his book bag , however detectives are not ready to release where the gun was located and how Holston obtained the gun .

Detectives said they believe that the child got the Ruger LCP .380 caliber semiautomatic pistol , owned by Cole , from inside the residence and accidentally shot himself .

Forensic pathologists said the gunshot wound was consistent with being both accidental and self - inflicted .

Holston 's parents , David and Haley Cole , released the following statement :
 " The family appreciates all the prayers from the community and would ask for the courtesy of privacy during this time .
One thing remains , God sent His son Jesus to die on the cross for everyone and He rose from the grave .
When we believe in Him , death is not the end , but the beginning of everlasting life with Jesus . "

A family friend and local pastor said the Cole family is devastated .

" God 's ways are higher than our ways , his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and that he ’s faithful in everything he does .
That helps that doesn’t fully remove the sting .
Obviously we’re going to miss having this guy around , " said pastor Paul Richardson .

He said the boy 's father sent him a text after the accident .

" Father sent me a text this morning .
He said that an accident had occurred and asked for prayers , " said Richardson .

No charges were filed in the case .
