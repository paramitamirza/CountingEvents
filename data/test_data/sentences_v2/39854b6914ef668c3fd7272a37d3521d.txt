* * * UPDATED at 5:12 P.M. on Tuesday , August 25th * * *
 Augusta , GA – Tuesday has been an emotional day for parents and loved ones of kids at W.S. Hornsby K-8 School .

Parents rushed to the school just a around lunch time only knowing that there was a gun at school .

One big sister can breathe a sigh of relief after an unexpected day for Maequoia . “
Well , you need to go pick her up because they had a shooting .
That ’s
the only way I found out , ”
Martika Jackson told WJBF News Channel 6 .

Her second grade sister told us she heard crying and saw people running out of classrooms .
“ We were taking a test .
I was about to get up , but she said , ‘ stay down and put your head down’ , so I put my head down , ”
Maequoia Reeves said .

We found out from the Richmond County School System ’s Communications director that a boy brought a gun to class against state and school policies .
A student was playing with a weapon inside his desk .
The weapon discharged and grazed a student in her side , ” Kaden Jacobs said .

Tasha Williams picked her child up from the middle school side of the building .
I had to rush up here to get my son out of school .
When I got here , the lady told me , ‘ you know it was at the elementary school?’ I said , ‘
well ma’am , I’d rather be safe than sorry , ” Williams said .

While some parents took precautions , others remained emotional until a Richmond County Board of Education Police Department ID check guaranteed them access to their kids .

“ It ’s not a comfortable feeling .
It ’s something we see on the news and we don’t expect it to happen so close and then , when it is close , you don’t know what to really think , ”
Joe’Micah Thurmond told us before he picked up his little brother .
A lot of stuff goes on around here , but one bad apple makes the whole bunch look bad .
So , it ’s not most of the kids .
Every now and again , you get one that gets out of line and gets a little crazy .
Whose ever weapon was found should have done better as to having it put up .
Child should not have had access to it , ” he added .

But inside , kids were prepared .
Cheyenne Ellison was one of them .
“ I would have got in the cabinet and acted like I was a cleaning substance , ” she told us .

India Ferrell was another one of them . “
It was right around the corner from my classroom ” she said .
“ How did you feel inside ?
” we asked India .
I was scared .
Yeah , I was scared , ” Ferrell replied .

That fear has parents planning what should be next…
 Shon Green said parents have a job to do .
“ Check the book bags and make sure your children aren’t taking things to school , ” Green said .

“ Maybe we can get metal detectors , or something like that .
That would work , ” said Sonya Logan .

The 3rd grade girl who was grazed by the bullet is “ resting comfortably at home ” , according to Richmond County Schools’ superintendent , Dr. Angela Pringle .
The 3rd grade boy who brought the gun to school was taken into police custody .

All of the other students are safe .
Many went home with their parents shortly after the incident .
