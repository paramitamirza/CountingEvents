 ( CBS ) — Five people were wounded in a hail of bullets from an automatic weapon in Chicago ’s Uptown neighborhood Monday evening .

Police and several ambulances converged at Wilson Avenue and Sheridan Road Monday evening , following the shooting , which occurred shortly before 6 p.m. near a bus stop in front of the Uptown Baptist Church .

According to 46th Ward Alderman James Cappelman , police have three persons of interest in custody and have recovered video footage from a nearby police camera and cameras from nearby businesses .
However , Police News Affairs Officer Daniel O’Brien denied that anyone was in custody , adding there is “ misinformation out there .
”

Chicago Police Supt .
Garry McCarthy earlier said investigators believe , from shell casings found at the scene , that an assault weapon was used in the attack .

It ’s ironic how things kind of come together .
You’ve heard me talk about assault weapons .
It looks like there was an assault weapon used in that shooting last night , ” said McCarthy .

These are not things that belong in an urban setting .
There ’s no reason for them in a free society .
That ’s a military - grade weapon that was created to kill people during combat .

That corner is located along the “ Safe Passage ” route for students attending Joseph Brennemann Elementary School , which is receiving students who attended Graeme Stewart Elementary School , which was one of 49 elementary schools shut down by the Chicago Public Schools this summer .
Stewart Elementary is around the corner from the shooting , on Kenmore Avenue , just south of Wilson .

 Police sources said three of the victims are gang members .
Two were innocent bystanders .
Police sources said three different gangs in the area have been fighting for territory .

Uptown Baptist Church Pastor Michael Allen said he heard the shooting was the result of one gang placing a hit on a rival gang member .

“ He happened to be standing where a group of others were standing , and so folks were caught in the melee , ” Allen said .
That ’s just tragic .
”

All the victims of the shooting were men , their ages ranging from 21 to 58 .
The youngest victim was shot in the head .

The victims’ conditions ranged from extremely critical to critical to good , the Chicago Fire Department said in a Twitter posting .
Police initially said one person died in the shooting , but later said that victim was in extremely critical condition at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center .

Witnesses said a white 4-door car pulled up in front of the church , and someone inside opened fire .

I heard what I thought was fireworks , ” said Joe Rogers , who was working security at the Uptown Shop and Save at the corner of Wilson and Sheridan when he heard the gun shots .

Allen said the church was hosting a prayer service at the time , and giving out meals to more than 100 homeless people .

“ We heard the barrage of shots outside .
There must have been at least 15 to 20 shots fired , and then after that , I went out to find out what was going on , and just saw carnage at the base of the church steps , ” he said .

Allen said pools of blood and the wounded victims lay just outside the church doors after the shooting .

“ I do believe at least two or three of the victims had either just come into the sanctuary , or to our meal , or were just leaving the Monday night meal , ” Allen said .

Rogers said there was blood everywhere .
He saw a white car speeding away from the scene .

“ I see three people down on the ground ; one on his back , one on his side , and one is face down , ” said Rogers .

With his church sitting along the border between two or three gangs , Allen said he ’s committed to the community .

This kind of stuff doesn’t scare us off .
We’re just going to redouble our efforts to love on the community , and show the love of God to people , ” he said .

No one was in custody for the shooting as of Tuesday morning .
Police were reviewing video from a blue light surveillance camera near the scene .

It was the second time in little more than a week that there was a shooting along a designated “ Safe Passage ”
route for a public school .
However , neither shooting happened during school hours , when the program ’s volunteers , paid “
Safe Passage ” workers , police officers , and other city employees will be manning the routes to keep kids safe going to and from school .

Mayor Rahm Emanuel said , starting Monday , there 600 newly trained Safe Passage workers , and hundreds more volunteers keeping watch over the routes , including at Sheridan and Wilson .

It is our obligation , not just because we work for the taxpayers – although we have a primary – it ’s the obligation of every adult to make sure a child is protected .
Whether you’re employed , or a city employee , or not , ” he said .

Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd - Bennett noted there ’s much more to the Safe Passage routes than simply placing yellow signs designating certain streets as part of the program .

“ Safe Passage is not just the geographic passage where children walk , it ’s a comprehensive strategy … involving multiple resources of the sister agencies , ” she said .

In addition to having police officers and firefighters helping keep an eye on the Safe Passage routes , the city ’s Buildings Department has secured or demolished 300 abandoned buildings on or near the routes ; animal control workers will be on the lookout for dangerous dogs along the paths ; Streets and Sanitation Department employees have been cleaning up vacant lots ; and Park District workers will provide security at public parks along the routes .

Altogether , representatives from 16 city agencies will play a role in the program once classes begin on Aug. 26 .

The other shooting on a Safe Passage route happened in Bronzeville on Aug. 11 , when one man was killed and another was wounded in the 2900 block of South State Street .
