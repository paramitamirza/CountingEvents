A 13-year - old boy was arraigned Wednesday in the death of a 14-year - old boy he allegedly shot in a shed behind a vacant home , according to the Wayne County Prosecutor ’s Office .

Frederick Austin , 14 , died around 7:40 p.m. Tuesday on the 5300 block of Radnor in Detroit , said Maria Miller , spokeswoman for the prosecutor ’s office .

“
It is alleged that a 13-year - old Detroit juvenile was with Frederick Austin ... and three other Detroit youths , ” Miller said in a statement on the charges .
“
The victim had a handgun and it is alleged that the 13-year - old picked up the gun , discharging it , killing Austin .
”

Austin was pronounced dead at the scene near Interstate 94 and Cadieux on the city ’s east side , police said .

The unnamed 13-year - old is charged with involuntary manslaughter , careless discharge causing death and felony firearm , Miller said .

The boy appeared in juvenile court Wednesday dressed in a blue sweatshirt , saggy pants and gym shoes .
In a brief hearing before Referee Nicholas Bobak , he received a $ 50,000 , 10 percent bond , despite a request by his defense attorney to be allowed to go home .

Bobak said given “ very serious allegations ” against the teen , his family would need to post at least $ 5,000 cash to bring him home while he awaits his pre - trial hearing scheduled for June 22 .

The teen on Wednesday waived the formal reading of the charges against him as well as his probable cause conference .
These are his first alleged offenses in the Wayne County juvenile system .

When Bobak asked his mother in court if the child listened to her instructions at home , she replied , “
He ’s hardheaded .
”

The mother left the brief hearing Wednesday without making any comments about what happened .

If released , the teen must have no contact with witnesses or the victim ’s family .
He also is to follow a curfew .

The teen tested positive for marijuana after his arrest , according to the court .
Bobak admonished the boy to “ stay away from marijuana ” if released from detention .

If convicted of the charges against him , the teen will be sentenced under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court .

Police late Tuesday questioned and detained the teen , who is a seventh - grader and football player at Marquette Middle School .

It was not immediately clear who owns the gun used in the shooting , according to Detroit Police Officer Dan Donakowski .

The youths may have been involved in an earlier dispute , Police Chief James Craig told Fox 2 Detroit .
Authorities also were probing the possibility that they were playing , Donakowski said .

The incident is the latest round of violence involving children in Detroit .

Since Easter , at least eight youths ages 15 and under have been injured or killed by gunfire , sparking outcry from police and residents .

Last week , the body of Deontae Mitchell , 13 , was found in an east - side field , days after he’d been taken at gunpoint outside a store .
An autopsy has been completed but the manner and cause of death remain pending .
