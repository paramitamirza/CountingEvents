An Ohio prosecutor says he will take the case of the self - inflicted gunshot death of a 3-year - old boy to a grand jury .

Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser says he thinks it ’s important to let grand jurors in the city of Hamilton hear evidence to decide whether there should be any charges .
Hamilton police say the boy had been playing with a handgun he found in his mother ’s purse when he shot himself Thursday .

In a 911 audio file released by police , a woman identifying herself as Marques Green ’s mother says she carried the gun in her purse , and had set the purse down after getting home .

It was the second apparently accidental gunshot death of a young person this month in Hamilton .
