" Opened our door about 2:20 and the whole neighborhood was blocked off .
It was getting taped at our front door .
We were getting ready for work .
We had to be escorted to the end of the street , " says neighbor Veronica Lopez .

Veronica Lopez says the normally quiet Hillview Drive was a sea of lights Monday afternoon .

" I kind of knew something was n't right because there was an ambulance that was n't being used .
There was a coroner van and too many detectives .
So I knew that it was all bad , " says Lopez .

 " Co - workers of Ms. Johnson had called concerned about her not showing up for work , " says Cleveland Police Chief Mark Gibson .

Police stopped at the home of Rachael Johnson to do a welfare check .
Johnson , her five - year - old son , and the family dog had been shot to death .

" It 's very hard to work a case with a child .
Any time a victim is innocent and
there 's no justification no reasoning behind an event , it 's tough , " Gibson .

Police found Johnson 's boyfriend , 31-year - old Ross Anderson , more than 130 miles away in Murfreesboro .

According to the Rutherford County Sheriff 's Office , early Monday morning , Anderson knocked on a random man 's door and asked for a place to stay .
The man called 911 .

" We were able to work with their law enforcement agency and the TBI to make contact with him , " says Gibson .

" I do n't think I 've ever seen the man .
My kids have but I have n't .
But they used to walk in the neighborhood .
Just a nice , quiet little family , " says Lopez .

Neighbors like Lopez say it is hard to comprehend .

" Just so much tragedy , I think .
Families affected .
It 's too close to Christmas .
Just horrible , " says Gibson .

Chief Gibson says Anderson has already been transported back to Bradley County .
He is being evaluated in a local health facility before being transferred to the Bradley County jail .

Anderson was a member of the Cleveland Fire Department for five years before being terminated in May 2014 .
