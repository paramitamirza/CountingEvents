A community is in mourning after a mass shooting this weekend at a northwest Harris County home left nearly two dozen people shot and two teens killed , and authorities say two suspects are still on the loose .
At a press conference Sunday afternoon , Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia described the event as a " birthday party gone wild . "

The violence unfolded just before 11 pm Saturday at a home in the 7300 block of Enchanted Creek Drive near FM 529 .

The Harris County Sheriff 's Office says at least 20 people were injured , and two of those victims are dead .
HCSO authorities tell us Queric Richardson , a 17-year - old student of Morton Ranch High School in Katy , died at the scene .
A 16-year - old girl died after being transported to Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center Hospital .
Her name has not been officially released .

Richardson 's father , Laurence Guidry , is having a hard time understanding how his two sons went to the party , yet only one of them came home .

" Queric did n't deserve this .
He was just a child , " Guidry said .
" He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . "

Relatives told us Richardson , who would have turned 18 next week , was a good student and worked at a local Dairy Queen .
His 16-year - old brother , Kenneth Guidry , was shot while trying to save him .

" He was shot 10 minutes before he even realized he was shot , trying to help his brother , " their father said .

Richardson 's brother was one of 18 survivors who reportedly suffered gunshot wounds .
A 19th victim has a broken leg , officials said .

Injuries range in severity .
As of Sunday night , one person remained in critical condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital .

A BIRTHDAY PARTY GONE WILD

According to HCSO , close to 100 people were present when the shooting happened -- most of them young adults and teens .
Guests were there to celebrate the 18th birthday of Mariah Boulden , who lives in the home .
Officials said Boulden 's mother was there as well .

Sheriff Garcia said the problems began when party organizers took to social media to promote the event .

" Anytime you promote a birthday party on social media , you have no control over who to expect at your door , " Garcia said .
" What it does is indicate , that your saying to the social media world , ' I do n't know who you are , but you 're invited . '
That 's not a good practice . "

Authorities said there was no provocation and no evidence of a confrontation .
The initial shot was reportedly fired in celebration , which caused someone to react and fire randomly into the crowd .

" It is just a horrible combination of immaturity , access to a firearm and the inability to control oneself , " Garcia said .

As the gunfire erupted , guests fled the home in a panicked rush to escape .

We talked to a young man who was at the party , who asked us not to show his face .
He described moments of sheer terror as bullets went flying and people were scrambling to get away .

" I 'm by , like , the garage and the door with the other people .
And I 'm telling and pushing everybody like , ' Move to the garage , ' " he told us .
Because I looked , and I could see him coming toward the door . "

The garage door is now bowed out .
That 's where deputies say people were pushing , trying frantically to get out of the house .

The anonymous witness said the shooting went on for three to five minutes .
When it ended , he walked by two young people who had been shot , trying to get to safety .

" I saw one guy .
He was lying on the floor with blood leaking out of his mouth and off his body and stuff , " the witness said .
And I saw another girl on the floor , and she looked like she was in shock , but she was also bleeding . "

The birthday girl said she was outside when the commotion began .

" I was standing right there and all I heard was shooting , " Boulden said .
So I ran toward the house , but the door was locked .
So my cousin grabbed me and we ran down the street and called 911 . "

HCSO officials said investigators arrived within five minutes of receiving the call , and the sense of chaos remained .

" Victims lying everywhere , people running , " HCSO Dep .
Thomas Gilliland described .
" Deputies were arriving , trying to figure out what happened , whether we had shooters on the ground , whether we had anyone with weapons still in the home . "

A SCHOOL DISTRICT RESPONDS
 Authorities said most of the guests at the party were high school students from the Cypress area .

Cypress - Fairbanks Independent School District officials tell us they plan to address the shooting Monday .

THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES

No firearms have been recovered from the scene .

Boulden said she never expected this to happen at her birthday party .

My brother and them were patting people down .
[ The suspects ] did n't want to get patted down and they walked off .
