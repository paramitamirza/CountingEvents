Griffith Park Fire
On Monday , March 12 , 2007 at 2:15 PM , 33 Companies of Los Angeles Firefighters , 2 LAFD Rescue Ambulances , 1 Arson Unit , 4 Helicopters , 1 EMS Battalion Captain , 4 Battalion Chief Officer Command Teams , 1 Division Chief Officer Command Team , under the direction of Battalion Chief Mark Saxelby responded to a Brush Fire at Griffith Park in ATWATER VILLAGE.
 Firefighters arrived quickly to discover a geographically treacherous area of Griffith Park with 3/4 of an acre of medium to heavy brush burning uphill in the direction of the famed Griffith Park Observatory .
Due to the inaccessibility of ground crews , the Fire Department 's aerial reconnaissance and command support airship flew into action and was soon joined by a trio of larger water - dropping LAFD helicopters , that commenced a synchronous aerial attack on the flames .

Due to the extreme weather conditions and low relative humidity , the Los Angeles Fire Department utilized pre - deployed resources to address the increased brush fire potential .
The first
seventy arriving Firefighters skillfully anchored the flames , working in concert with their airborne colleagues to limit fire spread .
A structure protection group was also established and stood at the ready should the flames reach the beloved landmark in Griffith Park .

In spite of the presence of numerous spot fires , and largely due to the determined aircraft , the men and women of Los Angeles Fire Department were able to limit the flames to 10 acres and fully extinguish the blaze in just 2 hours 45 minutes .
No structures were damaged .
No evacuation was ordered at the Observatory as it was closed for business .
A park ranger was transported to a nearby hospital with minor heat - related injuries .
