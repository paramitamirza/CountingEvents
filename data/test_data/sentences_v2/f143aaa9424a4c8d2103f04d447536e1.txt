“ I spoke to Cpt .
Shunta Boston Smith , who is the District 3 commander , by phone .
She ’s at the scene , " Flynn told reporters at the scene of another shooting , where a police officer was injured . "
She was on a neighborhood walk last week , talked to the family about their concerns , [ and ] jumped rope with the little girl , whose only question was whether or not we could keep her safe .
Sadly that question was answered tonight .

I mean , she ’s a little kid , man , nine - years - old , man ”
