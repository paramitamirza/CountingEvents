“ I just killed my cousin on accident : ”
Man charged after fatal shooting near 28th & Capitol
MILWAUKEE — 37-year - old Oliver Kennedy of Milwaukee has been charged in connection to the June 28th fatal shooting of 49-year - old Alac Jackson .

Kennedy has been charged with homicide by negligent handling of a dangerous weapon , explosives or fire by the Milwaukee County District Attorney ’s Office .

The shooting occurred near 28th and Capitol Drive around 2:15 a.m. on Tuesday , June 28th .

When authorities arrived on scene , they found Jackson suffering from a fatal gunshot wound — slumped over in a chair inside an apartment .

Officers and MFD attempted life - saving measures but were unable to revive the victim .
He died at the scene .

According to a criminal complaint filed against Kennedy , when officers arrived on scene , Kennedy was crying an on his cell phone .
He told officers someone had been shot in the head .

A 9mm semi - automatic handgun was recovered from the floor of the apartment .

An autopsy determined Jackson died as a result of the gunshot wound to the right side of his head , and his death was ruled a homicide .
The medical examiner noted that this was a contact wound — meaning that the muzzle of the gun was against Jackson ’s skin when the gun was fired .

The complaint indicates police spoke with a friend of both the suspect and the victim in this case .
This friend told investigators Kennedy and Jackson had a history of “ playing with guns and drinking .
”
The friend said he received a telephone call from Kennedy around 2:30 a.m. on the night of the shooting — and Kennedy told him that he and Alac were drinking and playing with a gun when he accidentally shot Alec .
The friend said Kennedy was crying and saying it was an accident and he didn’t mean for it to happen .

Investigators spoke with a witness to the shooting , who indicated after the shooting , Kennedy said “ I just killed my cousin on accident , ” and then dropped a gun .

Kennedy was interviewed by police , and Kennedy told investigators on the night of June 28th , he and Jackson were drinking when Jackson pulled a handgun from his waist and pointed at Kennedy .
Kennedy said this made him mad , so he walked toward Jackson and told him if he was going to point that gun at him , he was going to take it from him and use it .

Jackson had the gun pointed at the ground after racking it , and once Kennedy got to where Jackson was sitting , Kennedy said he put both of his hands on the gun and began to wrestle it away from Jackson .

As they were wrestling — the gun went off , striking Jackson .
The gun then fell to the ground .

Kennedy made his initial appearance in court in this case on July 3rd .
Probable cause was found for further proceedings in this case .
Cash bond was set at $ 5,000 .

Kennedy will next be in court on July 13th for his preliminary hearing .
