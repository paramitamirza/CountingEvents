Oil train derailments – are we ready ?
January 18 , 2014 -
In the last seven months three oil trains have derailed and exploded resulting in towns being evacuated , and 47 people killed .
The number of oil train shipments , carrying oil from the N. Dakota oil fields , and the Canadian tar sand fields , to refinery in the south , has skyrocketed in the last few years to an all time record .
Approximately 50 freight trains pass through Prairie du Chien , WI on a typical day , many are oil trains pulling 100 oil tanker cars .
The sheer number of these shipments means that while the chance of a derailment and explosion is still unlikely , it is much more likely now than it was just a few years ago .

Considering that oil trains transit many small towns through Grant and Crawford Counties , Midwest News wanted to know if city planners and emergency personal have plans in place to deal with a train derailment and explosion .
Midwest News talked with Crawford County Emergency Management Director Roger Martin See video .
Armed man surrenders after 12 hour standoff
On Sunday January 19 , 2014 at approx . 3:30 p , m .
Dispatch received a call of an ongoing domestic on Cyprus Lane in Bridgeport Township .
As officers responded the information gathered was that a 36 year old male had gotten into an argument with his 34 year old wife at their rural Bridgeport home .

During the argument and prior to officers arriving the 36 year old male had barricaded himself inside his bedroom with numerous weapons .
Sheriff Deputies arrived and took the wife of the man along with their four children out of the home and to safety .
The Crawford County Crisis Resolution Team ( CRT ) was activated .
The team is made up of members of the Crawford County Sheriff Dept .
, Prairie du Chien Police Dept . and the Wisconsin State Patrol .
The home was surrounded by members of the CRT team , Crawford County Sheriff Deputies and Prairie du Chien Police Department officers .
Myself , Prairie du Chien Police Chief Chad Abram and the two CRT Team leaders discussed our options in this situation said Sheriff McCullick .
We decided based on the fact that the General Public was in no way threatened , and the man was confined to his bedroom we were going to secure the residence and wait him out , added McCullick .

We had constant voice contact with the subject and we were continually attempting to talk him out of the room .
We made it as uncomfortable inside the home as we could , said McCullick and eventually he came out .
At 3:15 a.m. almost 12 hours after the initial call came in , the 36 year old man placed his gun outside the bedroom and walked out to our officers .
The outcome was exactly what we wanted , Said McCullick .
The male subject was extremely paranoid and delusional and sometimes those types of situations don’t end this well .
All of the officers involved in this did a great job .
We want to thank Tri State Ambulance as well , they were put on standby and they had an ambulance waiting less than a mile from the scene during the entire situation .

Midwest News asked New Horizons Supply Cooperative 's General Manager David Neal about the possibilities .

See Video When words fail By Dave Collins
 When tragedy strikes a neighbor in your area what do you do ?
How do you say you’re sorry , that you feel for their loss ?
Words often fail , but doing something to show your compassion is just the thing .
That 's what happened when Scott and Kari Brown of Whippoorwill Lane in rural Boscobel lost their 12 year old son , Briar in a tragic gun related accident on February 11th .
Someone thought that providing firewood might be of help during this cold winter , and a way to show support .
So the word went out for volunteers to cut up and haul firewood .

Todd and Deanna Sander donated part of a wood lot on their property bordering Harvest Lane .
On Sunday , February 16th , neighbors from miles around arrived with chainsaws , pickup trucks , log splitters , and all manner of heavy equipment .
There were perhaps 30 to 40 pickup trucks , and upwards of 100 people cutting , hauling , splitting , and loading pickup trucks with load after load of firewood .

A Canadian logging operation had nothing on this group .
The hill was alive with the sounds of chainsaws , and tractors pulling trees up the hill .
Men and women bent to the task with enthusiasm knowing they were sending a heartfelt message of community support to the Brown family .
We can all feel proud that we have neighbors this caring .
Meth lab busted , 3 arrested , 2 children removed Vincent Dahlberg Andrea Dahlberg Kellene Cull
On February 13th , 2014 following an eight month investigation into the manufacturing of methamphetamine ( meth ) the Crawford County Sheriffs Department obtained and executed a search warrant at 13812 State highway 27 , in the unincorporated Town of Fairview , Utica Township .

At 5:25 p.m. on February 16th members of law enforcement began the execution of the search warrant at the home occupied by Vincent and Andrea Dahlberg .
While doing so , numerous items associated with the manufacturing , delivery , and sale of meth where located in and around the residence .
The remnants of several “
one - pot ” meth labs found at the scene suggest the manufacturing practices have been taking place for sometime .

Three adults were taken into custody during the execution of the search warrant .
Vincent Dahlberg , age 51 ; Andrea dahlberg , age 37 , and Kellene Cull , age 41 .
Vincent and Andrea Dahlberg were arrested on charges of manufacturing meth , possession of meth , and possession of schedule 2 narcotics .
Cull was arrested on an outstanding warrant issued through Crawford County and may face charges associated with this investigation .

Vincent and Andrea Dahlberg could also face charges of child endangerment for exposing the two young children , who also reside at the residence , to the volatile process of meth manufacturing .
The two children were removed from the residence by Crawford County Human Services for their safety .
This case remains under investigation .
Recalls up to date ,
 reason for loss of power still unknown Bob Welsh ’s view of Mill Road as the brakes and power steering went out on his school bus .
Update - February 24 , 2014 - District Administrator Dr. Michael Garrow personally checked with Thomas Bus company , and determmined that the school bus in question had all required recalls performed .
His letter is as follows :
 February 24 , 2014 Re
: Transportation Services and Thomas Bus Recalls From : Dr. Michael S. Garrow
After speaking directly with a representative from Thomas Built Buses , I was able to confirm that Bus # 22 - the bus which experienced the loss of electrical power on February 6 , 2014 has no recalls on it that have not been addressed/updated .
The bus in question is a 2008 Thomas Saf - T - Liner EF bus purchased by the School District of Wauzeka - Steuben on June 29 , 2007 .
Since the purchase of the bus , there have been four recalls that were noted to be addressed .
1 ) a PC board issue – addressed in May , 2008 ; 2 ) a steering arm recall– also addressed in May , 2008 ; 3 ) a door handle issue ( to avoid corrosion ) – addressed in October , 2008 ; and 4 ) a dual power switch recall – addressed in September 2009 .
All recalls on the District vehicle were addressed .
It is the intent of the District and Board of Education to provide safe and responsible transportation to and from school , extracurricular events , field trips , and all scheduled school activities .
The safety and welfare of student riders is first consideration in all matters pertaining to transportation .
We strive to ensure all vehicles used to transport students are maintained in such condition as to provide safe and efficient transportation service with a minimum of delays and disruptions of such service due to mechanical or equipment failure .
Our school buses are inspected regularly in accordance with guidelines established by the Department of Transportation .
At this point , the District is not aware of what caused the electrical power loss on February 6 , 2014 and have taken the vehicle in for service to check into the matter further .
We applaud the efforts of Mr. Bob Welsh and his utilization of safe driving skills to ensure student safety when the unexpected event did arise .

Update - Wauzeka , WI , February 21 , 2014 –
Midwest News has learned that the loss of electrical power in the Wauzeka - Steuben school bus on February 6th may not have been a freak occurrence .
Our research found that certain models of Thomas school buses were recalled for a defect in power switches that resulted in complete loss of electrical power , identical to what happened to Mr. Welsh .

Over 17,000 Thomas school buses were recalled in December , 2008 for defective power switches .
The recall notice reads in part , “ Solid state circuit breakers may trip unnecessarily potentially resulting in a loss of power to the bus chassis and body electrical circuits causing an unexpected loss of engine power and exterior lighting .
Unexpected loss of engine power and exterior lighting could result in a vehicle crash [ emphasis added ] .
Dealers will replace the solid state dual power switch with a mechanical circuit production ( mega fuse ) .
The recall is expected to begin during February 2009 .
”
 Midwest News contacted the school district to see if the bus Mr. Welsh was driving , on February 6th , might have been included in this recall , and if it was included , was the recall fix completed .
District Administrator Dr. Michael Garrow was cooperative , instructing Mr. Peter Pomerening , the transportation manager , to release the information .
However , after five days of repeated calls to Mr. Pomerening he continues to refuse to release the information .

Had Mr. Welsh 's school bus been a half mile further along that steep , twisty Mill road when he lost brakes and steering , the outcome might have been far different .
People have a right to know that their kids are riding in buses that have been kept up - to - date with all safety recalls .
Midwest News will continue to seek the needed information ; year , make , and model of the bus , the cause of the electrical failure , if known , and the recall record of this bus .

Wauzeka , WI - February 14 , 2014 - Picture yourself driving a school bus heading down a steep and very twisty road when the engine quits , taking with it your power brakes and steering .
You stand on the brakes , pull on the emergency brake , but the bus still picks up speed .
This is what happened to Bob Welsh of Wauzeka , WI last Thursday , February 6th .
Listen while Bob tells us in his own words , what happened .

What went wrong with the bus ?
Good question .
The school district would not comment .
Wisconsin 's corrupt legislature Madison , WI - ”
As the legislative session winds down , the state Senate 's leader [ Sen. Scott Fitzgerald ( R - Juneau ) ] , is putting on the fast track a bill to rewrite campaign finance law to allow lobbyists to hand off clients ' campaign checks to lawmakers and other elected officials during the legislative session ” .
- Journal Sentinel Unbelievable !
- Perhaps we should install ticker tapes on each lawmakers desk , so they can sell their vote to the highest bidder in real time .
Mining committee votes to strip
 towns of local control

Millville home burns , no injuries On Saturday March 8 , 2014 at 12:30pm the Guttenberg Fire Department was dispatched to 2530 South Main Street in Millville .
Upon arrival of the first fire personnel it was determined to be a working structure fire in a two story home .

First reports from fire personnel were that fire had broken through the roof of the structure .
The fire department began a defensive fire attack on the structure to protect surrounding structures and contain the fire to the initial home .
After an initial investigation the cause of the fire was undetermined .
Because of the extent of damage to the structure a formal investigation did not yield any additional information .
The structure was too unsafe to enter and find a cause or point of origin .
At this time there are no immediate signs that the fire was intentional and is being ruled accidental .
Later in the evening the fire department returned to the scene to extinguish hot spots .
The fire department remained on scene until all visible fire sources where contained to the best of our ability .
Fortunately the owner , Joan Wacker , was out of the structure when the fire department arrived and there are no reported injuries .
The Tri State Chapter of the American Red Cross responded to the scene to assist .
The Guttenberg Fire Department was assisted by the New Vienna/Luxemburg Fire Department , Holy Cross Fire Department , Colesburg Fire Department , Guttenberg Ambulance , Guttenberg Police Department , Clayton County Sheriff ’s Department , and American Red Cross .
