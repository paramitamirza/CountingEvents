 Corey Singleton is out of the hospital and recovering at his home in Baton Rouge after he was shot twice early Sunday , once in the hand and once in the chest .

" One finger was hanging off and the other one was , like , blown off , and you can look inside my finger and see my bone , ” Singleton said .

" I tried to escape and run .
I got hit in my chest
and I got hit in my fingers .
It knocked one of my fingers off my hand . "

Singleton was New Orleans for the busy Bayou Classic weekend .

When he was heading back to his hotel early Sunday , gunfire erupted in the 100 block of Bourbon Street .

" I did hear the gunshots .
That 's why I turned and started running , ”
Singleton said .
“ I think it was a little too late because as soon as I turned , I got shot .
As I was turning , I was getting shot .
I think it was a little too late .
I actually pushed my friend out of the way so he would n't get shot either . "

Police said 10 people were wounded .
One of the victims was killed .

" All the police started gathering , getting everybody , ” Singleton said .
“
They actually had three other people surrounding me that was , like , on the ground .
I think one of them had got shot in the neck and
the other one had got shot in the leg and it broke his leg .
He could n't really get up . "

Singleton works in LaPlace at an oil refinery and enjoys amateur boxing .

" ( I 'm not ) getting my fingers back because they were ( blown ) off , so it 's just reality set in , ” Singleton said .

He said doctors were able to repair his fingers , but they won’t be the same .
The tips of the two fingers that were hit are gone .

Detectives said two men got into an argument and opened fire .
None of the victims who were injured in the crossfire were intended targets .

Singleton wants the gunmen to come forward and hopes to return to some sort of normalcy soon .

" I do n't think it will be difficult , ” Singleton said .
“
I 'm up for any challenges .
I 'm going to go see after a few months how this is going to work .
I 'm going to start back exercising , start back training , start doing things I thought I could n't do .
So I am going to find out on my own , eventually . "

Singleton said he will never visit New Orleans during Bayou Classic again .

Anyone with information about the case is asked to call Crimestoppers at 504 - 822 - 1111 .
