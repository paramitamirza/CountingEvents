Police tracing gun Englewood boy may have used to accidentally shoot himself
Police believe the 7-year - old boy who was killed Sunday in his Englewood home accidentally shot himself in the head with a handgun as he played with a relative .

Devon Lofton , a first - grader , died at Comer Children 's Hospital about half an hour after he was rushed there from his home in the 6700 block of South Aberdeen Street .

Devon 's 10-year - old brother brought the .22-caliber handgun into the house , police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said , and investigators are trying to determine who gave him the weapon or how he obtained it .
Police have interviewed the brother and are tracing the gun 's origin .

The brother hid the weapon in his mother 's dresser drawer in her bedroom , a law enforcement source said .
Devon , apparently knowing where the gun was hidden , went to the bedroom with another relative to get the gun , according to the source .

 While Devon was handling the weapon , it went off and the boy was shot , the source said .

Devon 's grandmother was watching television in the house when the gun went off , the source said , and his mother was running errands at the time .

Family members insisted the gun did not belong to any adult who lived there and they did not recognize the weapon , Guglielmi said .
The shooting happened about 3:50 p.m. as the boys played in the home .

" This is an unspeakable tragedy and clearly illustrates the long - standing problem we have with guns on our streets , " Guglielmi said .

Police do not expect criminal charges related to the shooting but are investigating whether the gun was involved in any previous crimes or shootings , using ballistics information to formulate a timeline for the weapon .

The results of an autopsy were pending , the medical examiner 's office said , as the police investigation continues .

Neighbors said the boy lived with his mother , grandmother and siblings in the three - story home on Aberdeen .
Andrew Holmes , a community activist who is working with the family , said relatives were devastated by the shooting .

Holmes said Devon " may have mistaken the gun as a toy gun . ...
But the real question is who the gun belongs to . "

 Family members gathered at the home Monday , with visitors stepping past a bouquet of red , heart - shaped balloons tied to the front porch .
A miniature teddy bear sat on the porch railing .

Devon was an outgoing kid who loved to play basketball , his family and helping the neighbors , his great - aunt Sheila Dordies , 52 , who lives in Indiana , said at a vigil Monday night in Devon â€™s memory .

Dordies was wearing a bright orange T - shirt over a white long - sleeved shirt like many of the family and friends who attended the vigil .

" This was his favorite colors , " she said with a small smile .

The vigil was attended by about 50 family members and friends , including small children .
They ran around and chased each other before the vigil , and a few tossed around bouncy balls or dribbled basketballs .

Bunches of metallic red , orange , silver and blue balloons were brought by people who came to the house .

" I love balloons , but I want to see balloons at graduations , not at prayer vigils , " said Darryl Smith , president of the Englewood Political Task Force , who spoke at the meeting .
" The only thing I ask of this community , my community , the people that are out here : When the cameras leave , when the police drive off and the crowd disperses , come back and support this family . "

Dordies said Devon attended Wentworth Elementary School .
After school , he would go to a local Salvation Army family services facility , where he would color and draw pictures of family members .
 "
That was his favorite spot , " Dordies said .
" He went every day to the Salvation Army . "

At the vigil , Corey Hughes from the Salvation Army held up a frame that had Devon 's picture and a picture he colored with his " signature " scrawled in black crayon .
Hughes said a prayer before giving it to the family .

" He would help any and everybody , " Dordies said .
"
He said he wanted the world to love each other .
...
That 's what he always used to say . "

Neighbors said the boy lived with his mother , grandmother and siblings in the three - story home on Aberdeen .
Andrew Holmes , a community activist who is working with the family , said relatives were devastated by the shooting .
