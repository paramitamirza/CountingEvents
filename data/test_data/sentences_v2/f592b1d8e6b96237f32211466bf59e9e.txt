Search on for gunman after 4 shot in Daytona Beach
Four people were shot outside a Daytona Beach club Saturday and the shooter is still on the loose , police said .

Police were told by the victims in the hospital that before the shooting near the Biarritz Club , the unidentified gunman got into a fight with several people .

The man left the area after the fight and came back with a gun .

Reports said the man fired multiple rounds outside the club and struck four people who weren’t involved in the fight .
Three of the victims suffered non - life - threatening injuries , while another was shot in the stomach and is fighting for his life .

“
Being a mother and knowing that ’s your child and your child is shot , you’re not hearing where she ’s shot or nothing , I freaked out , ” said Lisa McMillian , the mother of victim Latoya Kennedy .

McMillian hasn’t slept since she got the call at 3:30 a.m. saying that her daughter was shot in the leg .

McMillian said Kennedy wasn’t at the club , but at the park next door , getting an early start on celebrating her birthday .

“ I wish they’d get guns off the street .
I mean , when we were coming up , we fist - fought , ” she said .

Police said all four victims went to Halifax Medical Center , where they told police what happened .

No one was able to get a good look at the shooter .
McMillian said she ’s worried what could happen if there ’s more violence outside the club , which is feet away from Bethune - Cookman University dorms .

“
I thank God that there wasn’t ( a ) death involved , but it could have been much worse .
Innocent people , I mean , nobody should get shot , whether you’re innocent or not , ” said McMillian .

Detectives are working to identify the gunman .
They do know that the shooter was about 4 ½-feet tall , black and likely to be between 20 and 30 years old .

Anyone with information is asked to call police .
