Eric Summerfield
 Police Chief Roger Ellis says the Taney County Prosecutor filed charges of first degree murder and armed criminal action Sunday against 18 year old Tristin Carr .
He remains jailed on a $ 500,000 bond .

When police arrived at the home on Skyline Road a little after 7:30 Saturday evening , they found a young man with a single gunshot to the chest .
A police officer attempted CPR , but Eric Summerfield died at the scene .

" He had a life ahead of him , " says Melanie Whittaker , a family friend .

" He 'd just give a shirt off his back to anybody that needed it , " says Melanie 's husband , Chris Whittaker .
Eric used to spend a lot of time with the Whittaker 's children .
They called him ' Uncle Eric ' despite no blood relation .

Today , they are heartbroken .

" We loved him , " says Donald Oakley , Eric 's former step - father .

" Yep , innocent life gone , " says Melanie .

Eric had just graduated from Forsyth high school this year .
 "
His little baby brother , his mom was telling us last night , that 's the only word he could say , Eric .
Eric , Eric , before mom , before dad , it was Eric , " says Melanie .

" He was ornery , he was a good kid though .
Did n't have any enemies .
Everybody liked him , " says Oakley .

Above all , Eric loved his mother , says Melanie .

" Fun , outgoing .
Loved his family .
Loved his friends .... and nobody needs to forget that , " Melanie says .

" It 's gonna feel a little bit empty because he was always there .
He was like an older brother to me , " says Makayla Crockarell .

Rumors are flying on Facebook about the circumstances and possible motives ... but police have n't confirmed anything .
Not even the shooter 's identity .

" You see it all on social media and it 's crazy , they do n't need to put that .
You 've got two families hurting regardless of the situation .
there is two families out there hurting and a lot of loved ones on both sides .
People need to remember that and they 're not , " says Melanie .
