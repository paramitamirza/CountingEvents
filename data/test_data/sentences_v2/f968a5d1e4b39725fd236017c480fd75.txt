The discovery was made during a welfare check requested by a coworker around 1:15 Monday afternoon .

Police say 31-year - old Ross Anderson is in their custody with charges pending .

Cleveland Police Chief Mark Gibson says the the toughest part for many of those piecing together what happened is working an investigation that involves the death of a child .
Many , like Gibson , are fathers and parents themselves .

" It has a big impact , but we want to be as thorough as we can and we have a specific job to do and we have to separate that emotion from the job that we have ahead of us , " Gibson added .

Investigators believe this is the result of a domestic situation .

The investigation interrupted the commute home for those living in the neighborhood as officers required ID from anyone living near the crime scene .

" We never have any problems around here , ever .
This is the quietest neighborhood I 've ever lived in .
There 's a lot of older people that live around here
and we all know each other , " Angela Kelley , who lives nearby , said .

Several agencies were on the scene , including Cleveland police , Bradley County Sheriff 's Office , the District Attorney , and the Medical Examiner .
