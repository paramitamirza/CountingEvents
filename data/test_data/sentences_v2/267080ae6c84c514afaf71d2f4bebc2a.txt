 INDIANAPOLIS , Ind. ( Nov. 9th 2015 ) -- A game of dice turns deadly for two men in Indianapolis early Monday morning .

Two men were killed and two others remain in critical condition after someone tried to rob the victims .
The coroner identified the two men killed as Thomas Stewart , 22 , and Jonte Johnson , 24 .

Officers responded to a call about multiple people shot in the 400 block of North Beville Ave .
just before 3 a.m.
 Police have not made any arrests , but they do have a possible motive .

Police found dice and money scattered throughout the home , leading investigators to believe someone shot the victims during a robbery .

“ Detectives found evidence there was illegal gambling going on , but this was not a known illegal gambling establishment .
It was some friends that had gathered to participate in a game and during the game we believe a robbery occurred , ” said IMPD Sgt .
Kendale Adams .

Detectives do not think any of the four victims shot each other , instead at least one suspect and maybe more , came into the home and committed the killings .

Police say illegal gambling is not uncommon in the city and there ’s not much law enforcement can do to stop the crime .

“
We can’t just bust into someone ’s house and see if they’re illegally gambling or playing Uno .
This would be no different .
” said Adams .

“
I mean if someone ’s in their home and not bringing the attention of law enforcement , how would we know ? ”

While police don’t have any suspects in this case , they did reiterate they do not think what happened inside the home was a random act and neighbors in the area should not be concerned for their safety .

The names of the other two victims have not been released by police .

Officers urge anyone with information about these shootings to call Crime Stoppers at 317 - 262-TIPS ( 8477 ) .
