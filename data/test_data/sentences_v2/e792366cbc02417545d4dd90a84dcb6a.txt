Pittsburgh police said an argument led to a shooting Monday night Downtown that wounded four people shortly after the end of the city 's Fourth of July fireworks display .

Authorities are looking for the shooter , a young man police said was dressed in black , and a second young man who was arguing with the shooter .
Police said the second man was thought to be wearing a white dress shirt and a white undershirt .

The most seriously injured was a woman who was shot in the head .
She is in critical but stable condition , police said .

A man and a boy were wounded in the leg and are both listed in stable condition .

All three patients were taken to UPMC Mercy in Uptown , said Public Safety Department spokeswoman Sonya Toler .

The fourth shooting victim is a 15-year - old girl who was shot in the leg .
She was taken to Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh in Lawrenceville , police said .

The incident happened about 10:30 p.m. near the corner of Seventh and Liberty avenues , near the Wood Street T station , police said .

The Fourth of July fireworks began about 9:30 p.m. and concluded about 10:05 p.m. Thousands of spectators gathered in Downtown , particularly in Market Square , to catch a glimpse of the display .

Yellow police tape and squad cars blocked sidewalks and closed streets to traffic near the scene of the shooting .

Several police officers responded earlier in the night to Market Square where a large crowd of teenagers and young adults had gathered .
