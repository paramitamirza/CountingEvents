On Wednesday , November 9 , 2005 at 902
 Summoned by neighbors , firefighters arrived quickly to discover heavy smoke showing from a one story single family home .

Firefighters used power and hand tools to skilfully force entry through multiple security doors upon and within the redundantly secured residence .
While extending hoselines into the home 's entry to battle the well involved fire in the rear of the 1,336 square foot building , they discovered the lifeless body of an adult female .

Firefighters immediately rescued the woman and initiated basic and advanced life support measures while rushing her to Centinela Hospital in grave condition .

While continuing a systematic search of the smoke charged two - bedroom home for additional victims , firefighters mounted a bold and decisive interior attack on the fire , confining it to two rooms in the rear of the home , and extinguishing the flames in just fourteen minutes .

No other injuries were reported .

Despite the prompt work of Los Angeles Firefighter/Paramedics and exhaustive efforts by hospital staff , the approximately sixty - year old woman 's pulse and breathing could not be restored at the hospital .
She was declared deceased there at 956
 Seeking to offer additional comfort to grieving friends and neighbors , the LAFD mobilized Crisis Response Team volunteers to provide compassionate assistance to those closest to the victim .

During the initial phase of the fire investigation , there was no immediate evidence of functional smoke alarms within the home .

Monetary loss from the fire is estimated at $ 50,000 ( $ 40,00 structure and $ 10,000 contents ) .
A positive identification of the decedent , as well as the cause , manner and time of her death will be determined by Coroner 's officials .

The cause of the fire was careless smoking .
