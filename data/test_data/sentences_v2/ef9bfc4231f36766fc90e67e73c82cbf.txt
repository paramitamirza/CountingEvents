Neighbor hopes girl 's death reminds others : ' Put your gun away ' - wave3.com - Louisville News , Weather & Sports
LOUISVILLE , KY ( WAVE )
- Police said a 4-year - old girl died Saturday of an apparently self - inflicted gunshot wound suffered on Friday .

Ilanye Price was taken to Kosair Children 's Hospital Friday night after being injured at a home on Algonquin Parkway near 35th Street .

" When we heard the news , it was just like no , not her , " neighbor Michelle Powell said .
Powell said the young girl frequently came over to play in her yard . "
She 's four years old , " she said .
" She did n't even have a chance to live . "

Price 's grandmother told WAVE 3 News the gun involved in the incident belonged to a teenager who lives at the home but was n't there at the time of the shooting .

Officials could not say where the gun was being kept or how the girl managed to get to it .

LMPD spokesman Dwight Mitchell said other people were at the home when the girl was shot , but no one has been arrested .
Any decision on potential charges , he said , would have to be made by the Commonwealth 's Attorney 's office .

Last year , less than a mile from where Price was shot , a 4-year - old boy , Kamarion Posey , apparently shot himself in the head , suffering fatal injuries .
He died at Kosair Children 's Hospital on May 2 , 2014 .
The homicide unit investigated that case , but no charges were filed .

Powell said she is praying for Ilanye 's mother , and she hopes the girl 's death will serve as a reminder for others : " Put your gun away . "
