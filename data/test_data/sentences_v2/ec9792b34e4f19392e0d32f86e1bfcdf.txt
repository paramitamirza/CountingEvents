Girl fatally shot in Thornton street during house party
Police are searching for a young gunman who shot and killed a 16-year - old girl outside a Thornton home during a house party early Saturday .

The name of the girl has not been released and no arrests have been made , according to Thornton police spokesman Matt Barnes .

A suspect believed to be in his late teens or early 20s shot a girl in the middle of the 13000 block of Monaco Way at around 1:40 a.m. , according to a news release sent out by the department .

“ I heard the shots .
They were really loud .
You could hear people screaming .
People were running to their cars and driving away , ” said Neddie Sandoval , 77 , a neighbor .

There were two bursts of gunshots , with five or six shots fired each time , Sandoval said .
She was first awakened by nearby voices in the normally quiet neighborhood a half block away from West Ridge Elementary School .
It sounded like an argument , she said .

Minutes later , police cars with lights flashing filled the block , Sandoval said .
Police were talking to several witnesses , she said .
It appeared that a lot of people had attended a party , she said .
Police wrapped yellow crime - scene tape around several houses , including hers .

When police arrived in the area of Monaco Way and Krameria Street , they found a juvenile girl lying in the street with a gunshot wound to the torso .
She was taken to a hospital , where she was later pronounced dead .

Witnesses told detectives that some type of disturbance broke out during a house party .

One girl said on social media that she watched her best friend die .

“ I saw it all .
Watched u take your last breath .
Saw u at your best and never any less than that .
You fought but God decided he needed you back , ”
Julie Torres posted on Facebook .

The suspect fired his gun just as he was leaving the home , Barnes’ news release says .

The victim ’s friends mourned her on social media .

My best friend was more than just a 16-year - old girl who was at a party..
She was an amazing person , ” Alyssa Montoya wrote .
She deserves justice and I’m gonna get that for you I promise you .
…
I love you so much . ”

Torres also wrote about her loss .

She was my world .
The realist one out there .
Knew me better than anyone else I’d do anything to have her by my side again , ” Torres wrote .

On Saturday afternoon , Barnes said detectives were still trying to track down people who had been at the party and perhaps seen the shooting .

“ They’re still following up on tips and trying to identify additional witnesses , ” he said .

Barnes said there is “ no indication ” at this time that the shooting was gang - related .
He said the victim lived in unincorporated Adams County .

The dark - haired suspect was described as being “ skinny ” and about 5-feet-6 .
He wore eyeglasses and a gold hoop ring in one nostril .
He was wearing a gray sweatshirt .

Witnesses said he may have arrived in a red sedan .

The residential , normally uneventful neighborhood is a mix of retired couples and young families , Sandoval said .

It ’s really nice and quiet here , ” she said .
