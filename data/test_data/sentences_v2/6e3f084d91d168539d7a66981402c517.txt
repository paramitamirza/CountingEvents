AURORA , Ill. ( CBS ) —
Police are investigating a seven - hour spate of crime Saturday — involving two people shot , three stolen vehicles and a robbery — in west suburban Aurora .

About 5:30 p.m. , officers responded to the 400 block of Pennsylvania Avenue , where a 13-year - old girl , two 14-year - old girls and two teenage boys reported an armed robbery , according to a statement from Aurora police .
The group was walking when a green minivan sped up , stopped nearby and a man armed with a handgun and wearing a bandana over his face got out and demanded their property .
One of the boys handed over some jewelry and the robber jumped back in the vehicle , which sped away west on Plum Street .

One of the 14-year - old girls was treated at the scene for a minor injury to her leg , which she suffered when she was struck by the minivan when it approached , police said .

A few minutes later , an officer spotted the minivan stopped at a red light , westbound on Illinois Avenue at Randall Road , police said .
The driver sped away , and the officer pursued at a high rate of speed .
During the chase , the minivan disregarded several traffic control devices and the pursuit was deemed unsafe and subsequently terminated .

The minivan then boxed in a Ford Taurus near Route 56 and Interstate 88 , police said .
Four people , two of whom were armed , jumped out of the van and ordered the 63-year - old man driving and his 61-year - old girlfriend passenger out of the vehicle .
The couple , who were not injured , complied and the four people sped away in the Taurus , westbound on Route 56 .

About 5:50 p.m. , the Taurus rear - ended a vehicle at Prairie Street and Edgelawn Drive , police said .
The 68-year - old woman driving the vehicle , the only occupant , was not injured in the crash and the Taurus sped away .

Within 3 minutes of the crash , the Taurus was abandoned near Lake Street and Ridgeway Avenue , police said .
At least three people ran away from the car , but a search of the area did not turn up any of the suspects .
It was later learned that the minivan was reported stolen between 9:30 p.m. Friday and 12:10 p.m. Saturday from the 600 block of Gate Avenue , when the owner left the unlocked vehicle parked in the street with the keys in the cup holder .

About 11 p.m. , officers responded to the 100 block of North Ohio Street , where two people approached a group sitting in an outdoor common area , opened fire , yelled a gang slogan and then ran to a Jeep Wrangler , which sped away , police said .
A 10-year - old boy , who was sitting at a picnic table at the time , suffered a graze wound to the head and was treated and released at the scene .

Less than 10 minutes later , suspects matching the same description and driving a Wrangler were involved in a shooting in the 1300 block of Plum Street , police said .
A 52-year - old man had just backed his car out of a friend ’s driveway when the Wrangler approached and an argument ensued .
The Wrangler crashed into the car head - on and the man and his 49-year - old friend then approached the Wrangler , and one of the Wrangler ’s occupants pulled out a gun and opened fire .

The 49-year - old was shot in the neck and taken to an Aurora hospital , police said .
He was later airlifted to a suburban hospital , where his condition was stabilized .
He was expected to survive .

The suspects in the Wrangler also fired shots at an SUV that was driving west on Plum Street , police said .
The vehicle , which carried five juveniles , was struck twice , but no injuries were reported .
The suspects then abandoned the Wrangler and ran away from the scene northbound .
It was later learned the Wrangler was reported stolen about 10:30 p.m. Saturday from the 600 block of High Street , when the owner of the vehicle parked it on the street and left the keys in the ignition .
