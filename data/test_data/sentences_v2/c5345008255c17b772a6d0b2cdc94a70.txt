 PROVIDENCE , RI- It 's retaliation at its worst .
Firing a gun to make a statement is not only causing harm , its making residents feel uneasy outside of their homes .

Since Friday , there have been three shootings in Providence .
Norm Maher has lived near Curtis St. for years .
He says he hates the way people choose to settle a dispute .

" It just blows me away , " said Maher .

Around 10 Saturday night , four people were shot outside a family party on Curtis Street .
Police say one person was shot in the head , another in the back .
Maria Flores lives next door to where that shooting occurred .

Flores said , " It 's scary because those things never happen and we live here for 18 years and we are upset . "

Early Saturday morning , a possible " gang–related " shooting claimed the life of 20–year–old , José Sanchez .

A Puerto Rican flag , candles , and flowers now line the side walk where he was fatally shot .
Less than a mile away from the Sanchez memorial , a 16–year–old boy was shot in the leg .

With a weekend full of violence , residents hope that a reminder of recent tragedies will put an end to gun violence .

Maher said , " C'mon !
A 12 year–old girl , the 21 kids in Sandy Hook ...
C'mon , what 's wrong with the world ? "

Police are looking for a black Nissan Maxima in connection with the shooting that injured the four party goers .
