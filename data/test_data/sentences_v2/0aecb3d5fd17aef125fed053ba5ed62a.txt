Clinic pays damages to nurse fired during cancer treatment
Nationwide health care provider Dialysis Clinic Inc. will pay $ 190,000 in damages to a longtime nurse for allegedly firing and then refusing to rehire her when she needed more medical leave to complete treatment for breast cancer .

Francisca Lee had worked at the company ’s Southgate Plaza location in Sacramento for 14 years when she took medical leave in December 2008 for mastectomy surgery and chemotherapy .
After four months , according to a complaint filed in Sacramento federal court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , Dialysis Clinic notified Lee that she was being terminated for exceeding the amount of time off dictated by its medical leave policy .

This was done even though Lee , at the time of the notice , had been cleared by her doctor to return to work without restrictions in less than two months , the complaint said .
It said that Lee was told she would have to reapply for an open position .
However , when she did apply two months later , she was rejected , and not long after , the clinic hired a newly licensed nurse , the EEOC charged in its complaint , filed in July of last year .
The agency claimed that Dialysis Clinic ’s actions violated the federal Americans with Disabilities Act .

“ While DCI is proud of its record of employing and making accommodations for persons with disabilities , we have since taken a second look at our extended medical leave practice … , ” company spokeswoman Jessica Emler said in an email Friday , after she was contacted at Dialysis Clinic ’s Nashville headquarters .
“ We are committed to working with our staff as needed if their medical provider has determined that their situation requires additional time for treatment and/or recovery . ”
