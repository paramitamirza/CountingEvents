 Police reported that the scene near Brazos Street was secured within about an hour .

An individual was initially detained as a person of interest , but Manley later said the individual 's connection to the case had not been determined .
Police were interviewing that person and witnesses .

" With so many people being out at this time , there were a lot of people giving us descriptions , and those descriptions are consistent to a certain extent , " Manley said .
" But as you would expect , not all the same . "

Another shooting was reported at a parking garage several blocks away , near Eighth and Trinity streets , shortly after the incident on Sixth Street .

Police initially feared that an " active shooter " situation was unfolding , but Manley said investigators had determined the two cases were not related .

Witnesses detained a suspect in the parking garage incident , and he was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life - threatening .
His name was not released .

" With this being shortly after 2 a.m. , with the large crowds we have on Sixth Street at this time , all the individuals leaving the bars , it was a very chaotic scene — a lot of people running in different directions with all the gunshots that were coming out , " Manley said .

Austin police Chief Art Acevedo said the department would search tirelessly to identify and apprehend the person responsible for the shooting .

" On behalf of the Austin Police Department , we wish to extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the young woman who lost her life to this senseless act of violence and wish for a speedy recovery to the individuals wounded , " Acevedo said in a written statement .

Acevedo said anyone with video footage of the shootings or the aftermath on Sixth Street is asked to email police3@austintexas.gov .
