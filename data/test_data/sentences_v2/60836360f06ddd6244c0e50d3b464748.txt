Shooting in north Killeen leaves teen in serious condition
The Veterans Day holiday was violently interrupted for one Killeen family after a shooting left a teen wounded , and neighbors and police looking for answers .

The shooting occurred Wednesday afternoon in the 600 block of Bishop Drive .

Killeen Police Department officials said Wednesday they were unsure whether the shooting took place at the Bishop Drive residence .

We don’t where it happened , why it happened or how it happened , ” said Carroll Smith , a KPD spokeswoman .

Smith said the 15-year - old boy was transported to McLane Children ’s Hospital Scott & White in Temple in serious condition .
The boy was unable to tell officers where the shooting occurred , a KPD release stated .

Moments after the shooting was reported , just before 3:35 p.m. , EMS personnel could be seen administering to the teen , who was conscious when EMS personnel loaded him into a waiting ambulance .

Angie Hernandez , who lives across the street from the home where the shooting took place , said the alley behind the rental home is a hotbed of drug activity .

There ’s so much going on here at night , ” Hernandez said .
“ It ’s unbelievable .
She said the home was burglarized several times in the last year .

This house got broken into by some people about 15 times , ” Hernandez said .
I was in there checking the house when there was somebody in the garage still .
They stole everything out of that house .
As she filled out a police statement , Brandie Coss , who rents the home where police responded to the shooting , said she was in her room when the victim ’s friends entered and told her the 15-year - old living at her home had been shot .

“ We were in my room with the door shut and all three guys just rushed into our room saying he had been shot , ” Coss said .

Wiping away tears , she said the victim is practically family .

He lives with us , ” Coss said .
He ’s basically my son .
Coss said she expected the teen to recover .

Smith said the shooting is still under investigation .
