Six Shot At The Spot Tulsa Nightclub - NewsOn6.com - Tulsa , OK - News , Weather , Video and Sports - KOTV.com |
Police say gunshots appear to have come from all directions .

Several people were shot - including a security guard - at a Tulsa nightclub overnight Sunday .
One person had life - threatening wounds , but an update from Tulsa Police Sergeant Dave Walker indicates the man is expected to survive .

It happened around 2:30 a.m. near Pine and Yale when a fight spilled into the streets outside a bar called The Spot .

Police say the security guard was shot in the foot .
The man who was critically hurt was shot in the torso and another shot in the leg .

Before the 911 call came in about a shooting at The Spot nightclub , an officer patrolling the area heard several gunshots .
Police say a fight that started inside the club went outside and eventually led to shots being fired .

Police say at least one person was hospitalized in critical condition with life - threatening injuries shot in the stomach .
Another victim was shot in the leg .
A fourth victim has with a graze wound to his head , and two more victims also showed up to local hospitals after the shooting .

Several cars in the parking lots were hit with gunfire .

Tulsa Police Corporal Dan Miller said at least 200 people were outside the club when the shooting took place .

" We 're lucky there were n't a whole lot of people hit , so we 're trying to piece together what we can , " Miller said .
" People outside - most of them saying , ' I did n't see anything , I do n't know what you 're talking about , ' so that 's why we got officers at the hospitals trying to talk to the guys who got shot to see if we can find out what 's going on . "

Police say it 's unclear if the people shot outside the club were even involved in the fight that took place indoors .

A neighbor heard the early morning gun shots , but did n't think anything of it until he heard about the multiple people being hit by bullets .

" I 'm used to it .
I hear this every other weekend down here , I mean not every weekend , it 's not uncommon to hear gunshots in this neighborhood , " the neighbor said .

Corporal Miller said shots were fired in all directions .

" It looks like it because there 's casings back here towards the back ; there 's casings towards the front , so it looks like there 's probably a couple different groups that decided to start shooting , " he said .

One neighbor hopes the violence will come to an end .

" Yeah , I 'd like it to stop , " he said .
" I hear stuff at three in the morning , stereos , cars going by , walls shaking my house you know , loud - loud , wake you up out of a dead sleep . "

Police are interviewing witnesses at The Spot nightclub shooting to see if any of the victims were involved in the fight .
