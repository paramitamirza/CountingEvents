Officials : Boy , 15 , who shot himself accidentally in head dies
A 15-year - old Schurz High School student who apparently shot himself by accident has died , according to authorities .

Bobby McCullough , of the 4100 block of West Cornelia Avenue , was pronounced dead at 6:27 p.m. Friday at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center , according to the Cook County medical examiner 's office and police .

McCullough suffered a gunshot wound to the left side of his head about 7:45 a.m. Friday in the stairwell of an apartment building in the 4700 block of West Addison Street , police said .

When police got there , the teen , who lives about a mile away , was already in an ambulance , so officers spoke to two witnesses , an 18-year - old man and a 17-year - old Schurz classmate who lives at the Addison address , according to a police report .

The classmate said he 'd gotten a phone call from McCullough who told him he was going to come over .
A short time later , the 15-year - old knocked on his friend 's back door and all three began talking in the back stairwell , the report said .

The classmate told police that he heard a " loud pop"’ after peering down at his phone , the report said .
" He looked up and the victim was lying on the ground bleeding from his head with a gun in his right hand , " the report said .

A 45-year - old female relative who lives with the classmate came out of the apartment and tried to stop the bleeding with a blanket , the report said .

 The 18-year - old , who is listed in the police report as a gang member , told police he did not see the weapon fired , but also heard the shot and saw the boy on the ground .

The two teens and the 45-year - old woman were all interviewed by police , who listed the incident as an accidental injury .

A couple of hours after it happened , a black bicycle and backpack rested outside the apartment 's back door , which was stained with blood .
Nearby were a pair of black headphones and a pack of cough drops .

Karen Schabes woke Friday morning to screams and peered out her window to see two teens frantically running from a three - flat in Old Irving Park on the Northwest Side .

" It was horrific , " she said .
" It sounded painful . "

Schabes said the teens were screaming , " Oh my God , " as they ran from the building .

Wayne Sibenhaller , a neighbor who lives right off North Kilpatrick Avenue , said he was walking his dog early in the morning when he saw a boy run out of the back alley where the shooting occurred to flag down a gas truck .

" It was horrific .

 " The gas guy put his head out the window to say something , " Sibenhaller said .
