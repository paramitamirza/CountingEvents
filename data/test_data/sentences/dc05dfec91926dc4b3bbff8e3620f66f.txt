Six shot at nightclub
At 3:31 a.m. on Saturday , shots were fired inside the Key Club Cabaret on 85 Saint John St. , and over 100 patrons rushed out of the club ’s main doors , giving way to several New Haven Police Department officers .
They found six gunshot victims inside . NEWLINE
Continuing a recent trend of violence in the city ’s nightlife , five were wounded and Erica Robinson , a 26-year - old West Haven resident , was killed at the nightclub .
The incident increased the Elm City ’s 2013 homicide count to sixteen . NEWLINE
It appears that Robinson was not the intended victim of the shooting , and investigators believe that they have identified the shooting ’s true target , said NHPD Chief Dean Esserman .
NHPD detectives have interviewed several witnesses , though an official suspect has not been named . NEWLINE
“
I offer our condolences to [ Robinson ’s ] family for this completely senseless murder , ” Esserman said at a Saturday press conference .
“ I believe that New Haven Police detectives will honor the promise we made [ to her ] father and mother this morning in the emergency room when they asked us to please bring justice to this guy .
” NEWLINE
All available NHPD officers , along with many firefighters and emergency medical technicians from the New Haven Fire Department , were dispatched to the scene immediately following the incident .
The shooting took place in the Key Club ’s “ after - hours ” area , where patrons are allowed to bring alcohol after 2 a.m. , when the club is required to stop serving liquor .
Drug paraphernalia and packaging were found at the scene , which reeked of marijuana , according to a Saturday press release from the NHPD. NEWLINE Jahad Brumsey , a 29-year - old New Haven resident , remains in critical condition .
Additionally , one victim — 19-year - old Amanda John — was underage . NEWLINE
The incident was captured on video , which has helped the investigation move “ very rapidly , ”
Esserman said .
Also speaking at the press conference were New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. and Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy .
Despite increased security , DeStefano warned that the nightclub scene in New Haven is becoming increasingly dangerous .
Four of this year ’s homicides have been nightclub - related shootings . NEWLINE
“ To not see the connection with the clubs is to misunderstand what is happening .
With these clubs …
there ’s an environment that contributes to the risk of the people who are in it or near it , ”
DeStefano said . NEWLINE
DeStefano proceeded to discuss the various security measures imposed on local nightclubs .
One such measure is a requirement for licenses such as the Key Club ’s cabaret license , which allows for after - hours areas like the one where Saturday ’s shooting took place .
DeStefano also said that the city can not currently afford to station police outside all New Haven nightclubs , even though on Saturday there was a police officer stationed directly outside of Key Club Cabaret .
DeStefano said he has sought the authority to levy a fee on nightclubs to increase police presence . NEWLINE “
As we think about not only dealing with this issue , but how we can prevent this from happening , we can do more as a community to engage the club owners , particularly those who are not responsible , ” DeStefano said . NEWLINE
DeStefano said that in light of this incident , addressing the recent spike in nightclub - related violence has become increasingly important . NEWLINE
Malloy also shared plans for stricter nightclub standards throughout the state , citing protocol in cities like Hartford that have sought to address similar issues of nighttime violence at entertainment venues .
The governor said that he is ready to work with DeStefano , Esserman and other local leaders to pass stricter laws for nightclubs statewide . NEWLINE “
Although any number of homicides is too many , we are making some progress over the last two years in New Haven , ” Malloy said .
He added that the state has already begun measures to improve public safety , such as Project Longevity . NEWLINE
Malloy closed the conference by encouraging parents to carefully consider the dangers of the nightclub scene and situations like this before allowing their children to visit such places .
He added that there is no reason for underage patrons to be at these clubs late at night . NEWLINE
Ten of 58 New Haven shootings in the past year , including fatal and nonfatal , have occurred at nightclubs .
