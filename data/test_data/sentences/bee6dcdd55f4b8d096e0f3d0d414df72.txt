On a rare , rainy day in August , the swings were still and the benches empty at Oak Cliff ’s Glendale Park .
But , there ’s more than weather at play here .
Some parents say there ’s worry as well . NEWLINE
“ This is not good , ” said Devetta Jackson .
Jackson and her children live just down the street from the park and were troubled when police and paramedics blocked the street Sunday evening .
So she went to ask why .
The police was telling us that a child had got hit in a drive by ! ” NEWLINE
Police confirmed a 9-year - old was riding in a vehicle that was sprayed with bullets and taken to Dallas Children ’s Medical Center in good condition . NEWLINE
They were shooting from the park , ” said Jackson ’s 10-year - old K’Sean .
He and friends were playing outside when gunfire shattered the Sunday evening calm .
“ It sound like a machine gun going back and forth : boom - boom - boom - boom , ” while also adding that the gunfire sounded like more than one weapon was involved , as though “ people shooting back at each other . ” NEWLINE
Sandra Lover , who lives nearby , says she thought the commotion was an auto accident .
She ’s been a park neighbor for some 30 years and says increased police presence and better lighting have made the park a community asset that most view as safe . NEWLINE
Every weekend it ’s crowded with people having picnics , birthday parties , just enjoying the area , ” said Lover , who adds that she even takes her walks there .

You can’t even let your kids come to a safe place like a park and enjoy the day .
