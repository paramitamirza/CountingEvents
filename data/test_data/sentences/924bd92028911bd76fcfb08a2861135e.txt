City of Miami public information officer Frederica Burden talks of the multiple people shot on NW. 12th Ave .
in the 6500 block .
June 24 , 2014 NEWLINE One man was so immersed in the carnage surrounding him that he didnt realize he had been shot three times .
Another victim got blasted in the face .
And a 17-year - old girl , barely clinging to life Tuesday , was left with two bullet holes in her chest and three in her leg , family members said . NEWLINE
Moments before , at a small apartment building across from the Liberty Square housing complex , two men had pulled up in a dark SUV around 2:15 a.m. Tuesday as more than a dozen people were hanging out , talking and drinking .
The men climbed out lugging high - powered automatic weapons , and took aim . NEWLINE
When the shooting stopped , more than five dozen shell casings littered the parking lot , sidewalk and street .
Two men were killed and seven people were wounded in one of the worst mass shootings in Miami in decades . NEWLINE
The body of Kevin Richardson , 30 , lay covered by a tarp , partly obscured by a makeshift barricade , as dozens of family members and friends who flooded Northwest 12th Avenue , halfway between 65th and 66th streets in Liberty City , tried to sort through the chaos . NEWLINE
The Miami - Dade medical examiner didnt pick up the body until after 9 a.m. When Richardson was removed , his mother began to shriek , friends holding her upright as she swayed from side to side . NEWLINE
He said he was coming back .
I want my baby, cried Hermonya Richardson . NEWLINE
The other dead man was identified by police as Nakeri Jackson , 26 .
The teenage girl in critical condition  the only female shot  and the other victims were not identified . NEWLINE
Publicly , police said they arent aware of a motive . NEWLINE
But sources say the two men , carrying an AK-47 and an AR-15 , were firing at an intended target who might not have even been in the crowd .
The shooters had not been arrested or identified by Tuesday night .
Police were tagging beer bottles and other paraphernalia around the crime scene hoping to find DNA matches or other evidence that might help identify the shooters . NEWLINE
The motive at this point is still unknown .
Were still investigating, said Miami police spokeswoman Frederica Burden . NEWLINE
The scene was so chaotic that when reports circulated that three men had been arrested in connection with the shooting , police immediately said it wasnt true .
The reality : Three men were detained after tossing a Sponge Bob Square Pants bag that contained weapons . NEWLINE
Tuesdays shooting spree came a year after Miami - Dades last high - profile multiple shooting .
In the summer of 2013 , Pedro Vargas went on a rampage in Hialeah , killing six neighbors in his apartment complex .
Vargas was shot dead by Hialeah SWAT members who broke down a door and fired on him before he could harm two hostages . NEWLINE
The Liberty Square neighborhood where Tuesdays shooting took place and which runs roughly from Northwest 12th to 15th avenues and 62nd to 67th streets , has been plagued by gun violence over the years .
Tuesdays tragedy was at least the 13th shooting since 2009 .
In February , three young girls were shot by a friend seeking revenge . NEWLINE
Tuesdays incident was also eerily similar to a January 2009 double murder only nine blocks away .
That day , gunmen pulled up to a group of men playing dominoes and opened fire with automatic weapons .
Two men died and seven were severely injured .
Among the dead were two teenagers . NEWLINE
Though a man was arrested for the shooting , the case was dropped by state prosecutors after witnesses failed to come forward , and those who did began to contradict each other .
The most high - profile of the neighborhoods shooting deaths happened nearly eight years ago when 9-year - old Sherdavia Jenkins was gunned down in a crossfire at her home less than a block from Tuesdays bloodbath . NEWLINE
A park named in her honor now sits on the corner of Northwest 62nd Street and 12th Avenue . NEWLINE
Kevin Richardsons family spent Tuesday morning consoling each other behind police tape and about 100 feet from his body .
One family member , concerned witnesses might remain quiet in fear of retaliation , made a brief statement . NEWLINE
If you know anything , come forward and say something because it could be your child, Richardsons aunt , Bennae Robinson , said . NEWLINE
Miami City Commissioner Keon Hardemon , an assistant county public defender , said people should not underestimate the fears of his constituents . NEWLINE
The reality is the violence in District 5 is not a game, Hardemon said .
Its real life .
People have a genuine fear .
They have a real fear. NEWLINE Few people were coming forward Tuesday .
One woman described the shooting scene to friends , saying she ran into an apartment when the bullets started to fly .
But she retreated quickly when a reporter approached . NEWLINE
At Jackson Memorial Hospitals Ryder Trauma Center , where the victims were taken by Miami Fire Rescue , and where friends and family gathered , people sat on the grass chatting and speaking on their cellphones . NEWLINE
A woman whose 31-year - old son was shot said she lives across the street from the crime scene .
She said her son was simply hanging out on a hot summer night , talking and drinking with friends when the barrage began . NEWLINE
When the smoke cleared , I just saw bodies, she said . NEWLINE
The woman said when she ran outside she found her son helping victims , and that he didnt even realize he was one himself until someone pointed out his wounds .
She said her sons friend , who was shot dead , had been planning his childs first birthday party . NEWLINE
Now she wants to move . NEWLINE
It makes me so scared, the woman said . NEWLINE
The brazen shootings directly across the street from the old Pork N Beans apartments attracted most of Miamis police brass as well as City Manager Daniel Alfonso , who said he planned to sit down with senior command staff to reevaluate the neighborhoods needs . NEWLINE
Miami Police Chief Manuel Orosa said he has bolstered Liberty Square patrols with six additional officers , but there was little they could do at the apartment complex on the east side of Northwest 12th Avenue , across the street .
Orosa said an officer on patrol at a nearby school heard the gunfire and rushed to the scene , but it was much too late . NEWLINE
Its a sad situation, the chief said .
Weve never had any calls , any problems in this apartment building.
