Chattanooga firefighters battle 2-alarm motel fire
Several families have been displaced after fire ripped through the Airport Inn motel at 7725 Lee Highway Monday afternoon .
A clerk at the motel 's front desk was reportedly one of the first to notice the smoke and immediately went door - to - door to alert the residents .
Passing motorists on Lee Highway and on Interstate 75 also saw flames shooting through the roof of the two - story structure and called 911 . NEWLINE
The Chattanooga Fire Department received the alarm at 2:25 p.m. and responded with six fire companies .
Seeing the size of the fire upon arrival , Captain Jeff Eldridge with Quint 8 requested a second alarm response , which brought in an additional six fire companies . NEWLINE
Battalion Chief Winston Shields , the incident commander , said the flames had made their way into the attic , making it that much more difficult for the firefighters to get the fire out .
The hot afternoon temperatures also added to the stress .
One firefighter was transported by Hamilton County EMS to Erlanger Medical Center to be treated for what appeared to be heat exhaustion .
Another firefighter had to be taken out of the firefighting operation after he also showed signs of heat exhaustion .
He was treated on the scene and allowed to return to duty . NEWLINE
The firefighters used several hand - held hoselines and master streams from aerials in an effort to keep the fire from destroying the entire 12-unit building .
Several firefighters also got on the roof and used power saws to make a " trench cut , " which gave the firefighters access to the flames in the attic .
Chief Shields said it took roughly 45 minutes to get most of the flames out , but it would take much longer to finish putting out hot spots . NEWLINE
Aside from the firefighters who were treated for heat exhaustion , there were no reports of any fire - related injuries .
Most of the residents in the motel were evacuated immediately .
However , at the time of this release , a complete search of the fire - damaged units was still under way . NEWLINE
Chief Shields also requested a partial response from the department 's haz - mat team .
Based on observations on how fast the fire spread , and an apparent past history of meth labs at that motel , the haz - mat personnel are using special chemical monitoring devices to help confirm whether or not a meth lab was involved .
Meantime , several fire investigators are also on the scene , working with the haz - mat personnel in an effort to determine what started the blaze .
A dollar estimate on the damages was not available . NEWLINE
Several residents in the motel said they did not hear any smoke alarms at the time of the fire .
Assistant Fire Marshal David Brooks said he would be investigating those reports . NEWLINE
Several volunteers with the American Red Cross arrived on the scene to provide assistance to the burned out families . NEWLINE
Chattanooga Police , Chattanooga - Hamilton County Rescue and Hamilton County EMS provided assistance on the scene .
The Tri - Community Volunteer Fire Department also assisted by providing a special monitoring device to help determine if a meth lab was involved . NEWLINE
Chattanooga fire officials have estimated the dollar loss from Monday 's fire at the Airport Inn at around $ 750,000 .
Lieutenant Anthony Moore with the Fire Investigation Division said 8 to 10 rooms were damaged by fire or water .
Some adjacent rooms sustained smoke damage .
Fortunately , Chattanooga firefighters were able to save most of the two - story , 80-room building .
No injuries were reported . NEWLINE
The cause of the fire appears to be accidental in nature .
Lt .
Moore believes the fire actually started outside , next to the building .
The burn patterns indicate that the fire started in the mulch and traveled up a wooden column into the attic .
From there , the flames spread quickly through the attic until the firefighters gained access to extinguish the fire . NEWLINE
As to what sparked the blaze , the exact cause may never be confirmed .
However , Lt .
Moore said that many cigarette butts were found in the area where the fire started .
Meantime , representatives with the fire marshal 's office will be checking into reports from some of the residents that the fire alarm system did not work .
If infractions are found , the owner could be cited to court for a misdemeanor charge . Â
