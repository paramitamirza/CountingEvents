Fatal Pigtown shooting brings city count to 20 in 80 hours
An infant child was found next to her dying mother just before dawn Tuesday after police say a man broke into a Pigtown home , killed a young couple and shot two others — a grisly scene that brought to 20 the number of people shot in the city in a span of 80 hours . NEWLINE
Police said they had charged 35-year - old Melville Mason , who they said was caught trying to escape the home .
The arrest came as officials sought to address concerns about spiking crime amid a violent summer and a recent outburst of street robberies throughout the city . NEWLINE
" The biggest fear is the threat of retaliation , and that 's what we need to get in front of , " Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said at an afternoon news conference at police headquarters . NEWLINE
Officials said they would pull officers from administrative roles to bolster patrol ranks , and announced arrests in other cases — including a fatal stabbing of a teen after the Ravens ' Super Bowl victory parade . NEWLINE
Murders and non - fatal shootings both remain higher than at this time last year by double - digit percentages , and the city is in danger of reversing six consecutive years of declines in non - fatal shootings . NEWLINE
In the Pigtown shooting , sources with knowledge of the case said police believe Mason may have been involved in a dispute with one of the victims days earlier , broke in and opened fire .
He then left , retrieved another gun and returned , according to the sources . NEWLINE
Baltimore City Council Vice President Edward Reisinger , who represents the Pigtown neighborhood where Tuesday 's shooting occurred , said he 's been told by police that many of the recent shootings stem from drug disputes . NEWLINE
" When you see a spike — especially if it 's shootings and homicides — even if it 's drug - related , the people who live in that neighborhood , the families , the kids , the grandmothers , they do n't know what 's going to happen , " he said . NEWLINE
Women and children have been caught up in the violent spate .
In addition to Tuesday 's shooting of three women , a woman was shot in the leg Monday night in Perkins Homes housing project in Southeast Baltimore and a 7-year - old boy was among three people shot Saturday night in Johnston Square . NEWLINE
" We 've had a rough couple of weeks , " said Jerry Rodriguez , another deputy commissioner . NEWLINE
He said police would be out in force " to reassure that we , as your Police Department , are doing everything we can to …
guarantee your safety .
"
The commanders said citizen tips have helped police close cases , but they would need more help . NEWLINE
" We want you to understand we can only do so much , " he said .
" We 're asking the community to please share in our frustration and share in our anger and provide us with information . " NEWLINE
Mayor Stephanie Rawlings - Blake said in a statement that " senseless acts of bloodshed are unacceptable and strengthens my resolves to make our neighborhoods safer . " NEWLINE
" I have confidence that police are taking steps to get violent offenders off the street , " she said . NEWLINE
In Pigtown , about 30 residents stood on sidewalks or porches Tuesday , watching police officers , homicide detectives and crime scene technicians go into and out of the two - story rowhouse in the 1200 block of S. Carey St. NEWLINE " It 's so peaceful around here , there 's no crime , " said neighbor Margit Clokey .
" This is a shocker .
It 's so close to home . " NEWLINE
About 5:47 a.m. , officers arriving on the block said , they saw Mason crawling out of a rowhouse window . NEWLINE
Police , who said they recovered at least one weapon , took him into custody , entered the house and found Meghan Kerrigan , 22 , and William Monroe , 21 , fatally shot .
Neighbors say Kerrigan and Monroe were the parents of the infant , who was unharmed inside .
Police said they turned the child over to relatives . NEWLINE
Two women believed to be in their 40s were also found and taken to area hospitals .
One was listed in critical condition Tuesday and one was in stable condition .
Neighbors say one of them is Monroe 's mother , who has lived in the rowhouse for more than two decades . NEWLINE
Neighbors say the family worked in the scrap metal and recycling business , while Monroe also worked as a roofer .
They were well liked and kept to themselves , caring for their child , Clokey said . NEWLINE
Mason , neighbors said , lived just a few houses away at the corner of South Carey and Carroll streets in a basement apartment .
He has prior addresses in Sykesville , court records show . NEWLINE
Evelyn Lawson , Mason 's grandmother , said he is a churchgoing , married man and a good father to his 1-year - old daughter .
She said she could not believe the allegations . NEWLINE
" This is all news to me about what happened , " she said .
" His family all loves him .
We all love him .
This is a terrible tragedy . " NEWLINE
Police have not released specifics of the charges , and Mason does not have a lawyer listed in online court records on these allegations .
Online court records show multiple arrests and assault and drug convictions . NEWLINE
Several residents knew Mason as " P.J. , " and said he often parked his four vehicles — two Trans Ams , a Subaru Outback and a blue pickup truck — on the street next to his house , taking up every nearby space . NEWLINE
Henry Ott , 67 , lived next door and said he often argued with Mason .
The two had feuded because Ott kept watch of Mason 's comings and goings . NEWLINE
" He tried to rule the neighborhood and tell the people how to live , " Ott said . NEWLINE
Melissa Borck , who grew up in the neighborhood , said Mason could be standoffish .
His treasured cars were " all he talked about , " she said . NEWLINE
She said she was headed to the store at about 5 a.m. on Tuesday when she saw Mason sitting in one of his black sports cars across from his home .
He motioned for her to come over , Brock said , but she refused . NEWLINE " Happened right after that , " she said .
" I 'm shocked .
Maybe I 'll cry later when I see it [ on the news ] .
I 'm still shocked . " NEWLINE
As detectives overheard neighbors talk openly about Mason , police cordoned off his home and knocked on the door .
No one answered , and police soon summoned a red tow truck with flames on the hood to tow away one of Mason 's cars parked on Carroll Street . NEWLINE
In addition to Mason 's arrest , police said they had charged a 16-year - old , Nazir Williams , in a fatal stabbing that occurred downtown after the Super Bowl parade in February . NEWLINE
