Four teenagers were shot , one fatally , while sitting in a parked van on the Southwest Side late Tuesday night , police and witnesses said . NEWLINE
The teens were sitting in the 2700 block of West 53rd Street when someone pulled up alongside them in a red minivan and fired multiple shots at them , according to Officer Jose Estrada , a Chicago Police spokesman . NEWLINE
Ruben Orozco , who lives on the block , said he was jolted awake by six gunshots in rapid succession , followed by the screeching of tires .
He came outside and saw a teen lying still in the street alongside three others , who were " screaming and crying . " NEWLINE
Police said an 18-year - old man was shot in his upper chest and pronounced dead on the scene . NEWLINE
The Cook County Medical Examiner 's Office identified him as Jason Napoles , of the 2500 block of South Christiana Avenue . NEWLINE
Another 18-year - old was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital after being shot in his back , Estrada said .
Police could not provide his condition but said he was " stable . " NEWLINE
Two other men , 18 and 19 , were taken Stroger Hospital , where they were both " stable , " Estrada said .
The 18-year - old was shot in his back and the 19-year - old was shot in both arms and grazed in his head . NEWLINE
Police said all four teens were " self - admitted " gang members , and Orozco said he 'd seen all four of them walking around the area calling out gang slogans and flashing signs . NEWLINE
After a quiet couple of years , Orozco said , the block has started to see a resurgence in crime .
He installed a camera outside his home , advertising it with a sign saying " Smile , you 're on camera , " but he said it 's done little to deter troublemakers . NEWLINE
" It 's kind of a cycle , where some people will move in and cause all kinds of problems , " said Orozco , who 's lived on the block for 10 years .
" Then they 'll get chased out , it 'll be calm for a while , and then someone else will move right in and take their place . " NEWLINE
" It gets me really upset , " Orozco added .
The quiet residential neighborhood had already been on edge ; in February , neighbors were devastated when an entire family was slain in their home about four blocks away from the shooting . NEWLINE
In the face of such trauma , Orozo said , many neighbors feel that Ald .
Ed Burke ( 14th ) , the powerful chairman of the City Council Finance Committee , has been missing in action . NEWLINE
" We 're all very upset with him right now , " he said .
" He 's downtown making all that money , and a lot of us really feel like he is n't tending to his ward . " NEWLINE
Orozco tried four times to secure a meeting with the alderman , he said , and was turned down every time . NEWLINE
Down the block , another woman shared Orozco 's frustration . NEWLINE
" He 's such a big name , everybody knows Ed Burke , " said the woman , who declined to say her name for fear of retribution .
" But what 's he done for us ?
Nothing .
He does n't care about us . " NEWLINE
Seeing the shooting unfold in real time right outside her home , she said , lit a fire under her advocacy for a larger police presence and a camera at the intersection of 53rd Street and Washtenaw Avenue . NEWLINE
" I 'm really scared now , because my husband works nights , " she said .
" Something really needs to be done here , because it 's getting worse .
We fear for our lives over here . " NEWLINE
No one is in custody , Estrada said . NEWLINE
