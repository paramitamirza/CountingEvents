Initial witness statements indicate the gun went off when it was knocked over and fell to the floor .
Police are trying to determine the circumstances of the matter .
Hasty said investigation is ongoing to determine whether charges will be filed as well as whether the weapon was properly stored .
Hasty in the statement also included tips from Project Child Safe and the National Shooting Sports Foundation .
They are as follows:•
Always keep the firearm ’s muzzle pointed in a safe direction .
A “ safe direction ” means that the gun is pointed so that even if an accidental discharge occurred , it would not result in injury.•
Always keep your finger off the trigger until you actually intend to shoot .
When handling a gun , rest your finger outside the trigger guard or along the side of the gun .
Don’t touch the trigger until you are actually ready to fire.• Firearms should be unloaded when not actually in use .
Whenever you pick up a gun , such as when removing it from or returning it to storage , remember to point it in a safe direction and make sure it is unloaded.• Be sure you know how your firearm operates : read the manual on your firearm , know how to safely open and close the action of the firearm and know how to safely remove any ammunition from the firearm and its magazine.• Store your firearms in a locked cabinet , safe , gun vault or storage case when not in use , ensuring they are in a location inaccessible by children and can not be handled by anyone without your permission.• Store your ammunition in a locked location separate from firearms.• Use a gun locking device that renders the firearm inoperable when not in use .
A gun lock should be used as an additional safety precaution and not as a substitute for secure storage.• Make sure young people in your home are aware of and understand the safety guidelines concerning firearms .
Have them sign the Project Child Safe Pledge for young people—a reminder that if they find an unattended firearm in their home or a neighbor ’s to not touch it , and tell an adult.• Always unload , clean and place your firearms in their secure storage location immediately after returning from a hunting trip or a day at the range.• Educate everyone in your family about firearms safety .
