A man was killed and another injured early this morning less than a mile from where the mayor is scheduled to walk with community leaders , clergy and concerned citizens , starting at 7 p.m. at the Herring Run Library at 3801 Erdman Avenue . NEWLINE
The double shooting took place around 2:30 this morning in the 1800 block of East Lanvale Street , police said .
A gunman opened fire on two men .
One died at 4:45 a.m. , while the other is listed in stable condition .

At 3:45 this afternoon , four men were shot in West Baltimore ’s Harlem Park neighborhood , according to police , who have not released their names or condition , though all are believed to have survived the attack . NEWLINE
The shootings took place on Carrollton Avenue , near Harlem Avenue , just four blocks from Bennett Place , an alley street that has been the scene of three murders so far this year . NEWLINE
The uptick in violence –
nearly 50 shot since June 21 and 19 killed – has been attributed to the drug trade and turf battles between rival gangs by Police Chief Anthony Batts . NEWLINE
Began in late June NEWLINE
The shooting spree – the worst in the city in many years – has become the biggest challenge yet faced by Batts , who was hired nine months ago by Mayor Rawlings - Blake to run the police force . NEWLINE
A palpable sense of fear and revulsion by many city residents – capped by a 10-mile march last Friday on North Avenue by 600 men – is also a blow to the prestige of the mayor , who has pledged crime reduction to be her No . 1 priority . NEWLINE
Tonight ’s safety walk was announced by the mayor ’s office before the latest shootings in West Baltimore .
She is scheduled to be at the walk for about an hour . NEWLINE
The spike in violence began on Friday , June 22 , when the mayor was attending a five - day conference of mayors in Las Vegas .
Returning to the city on June 26 , she noted at a press conference the importance of reducing the number of illegal handguns in Baltimore and other cities , a matter she and other mayors debated during the conference and passed a resolution directed at Congress . NEWLINE
Last week , she led a safety walk through the McElderry Park neighborhood in East Baltimore , near a quadruple shooting that left 18-year - old Donyae Jones dead . NEWLINE
The mayor has repeatedly called on the community to help police find and lock up the perpetrators , while Chief Batts told reporters on June 26 that he had gotten matters under control . NEWLINE
He faulted his office for not releasing more information about police efforts to find the murderers .
He also disclosed that he had demoted chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi following his comment that the department was overall satisfied
“ with the way the city is headed , violence - wise .
” NEWLINE
Since then , official information from the police has been relatively scant , but last week the city registered the lowest weekly number of homicides ( three ) since the end of May , and there was a sense that the worst of the violence was over .
