Instead , one of the bullets hit Ariana Wilson , a 10-year - old sitting on her living room couch .
And the teen who allegedly pulled the trigger , as well as the man police believe helped him orchestrate the botched retaliatory shooting , were taken into custody about 6 a.m. Wednesday . NEWLINE
" We 've got a neighborhood , a community and a city that were traumatized by this shooting and rightfully so , " Deputy Police Chief Brian Foley said , adding that " the 10-year - old and her family had nothing to do with any of this . " NEWLINE
The 17-year - old suspect , of Hartford , has been charged with first - degree assault , conspiracy to commit first - degree assault , unlawful discharge of a firearm and reckless endangerment , court records show .
Police did not release his name because he 's a juvenile . NEWLINE
Police also arrested Kwanze Fluker , 22 , of Bloomfield , the man police say drove the Honda Accord used in the drive - by shooting .
That car was recovered last week in Manchester , Foley said . NEWLINE
Fluker was taken into custody at his home , where police also recovered a Glock they believed was used in Ariana 's shooting .
It had been reported stolen out of Glastonbury . NEWLINE
Police served an additional warrant for a separate shooting , one that occurred Oct. 30 on Blue Hills Avenue , according to Foley .
Fluker allegedly used the same Glock recovered Wednesday in that shooting , according to police . NEWLINE
He was arraigned Wednesday afternoon in Superior Court on a charge of conspiracy to commit first - degree assault in the drive - by shooting .
He was charged with first - degree assault and related charges in the Oct. 30 shooting . NEWLINE
Investigators were led to Fluker in part after shell casings from the earlier shooting were identified as a positive match to ones found at the scene of the Nov. 6 incident , according to an arrest warrant filed by police .
His bail for both cases was set at a total of $ 2 million . NEWLINE
Ariana was shot in the jaw just before 4 p.m. inside her family 's home .
She remained at Connecticut Children 's Medical Center , where she has received treatment since the incident . NEWLINE
The projectile hit her in the right side of her face and traveled to the area around her left eye .
It remained lodged there Wednesday , Foley said .
It is scheduled to be removed this week , and doctors are hopeful her vision will not be damaged . NEWLINE
A member of the Wilsons ' extended family was the target of the shooting , but was n't residing on Branford Street when the incident took place , according to Foley . NEWLINE
The arrest warrant filed in the case says police interviewed Ariana 's uncle , who told investigators that he had no knowledge of her shooting and had been " kicked out of the house " two weeks before it happened . NEWLINE
Days later , a witness interviewed by detectives said he heard Fluker and the teenage suspect discussing the shooting on Branford Street , according to the arrest warrant .
The pair said they " shot up the house " because the person who was responsible for shooting the gunman 's house the day before lived there . NEWLINE
In discussing the shooting , according to the warrant , the two suspects identified the house as the one where the " little girl " got shot . NEWLINE
Foley said finding those who fired into Ariana 's house had been a priority for police since the shooting , putting it " at the top of their list . " NEWLINE
" It 's disgusting and nauseating to have to watch and go through something like that , " Foley said . NEWLINE
In recent weeks , there 's been a " significant increase " in gunfire in Blue Hills , an uptick that investigators attribute to an ongoing dispute between rival groups . NEWLINE
That increase helped police pursue Ariana 's case , Foley said . NEWLINE
" Early on , within hours of the shooting , we had a group of suspects .
Within a day , we had it narrowed down , " Foley said .
" Once we snagged the car , it was only a matter of time , and that time was this morning . " NEWLINE
News of the arrests Wednesday heartened community activists who have been supporting the Wilsons since the shooting . NEWLINE
" It 's a wonderful feeling to be able to wake up this morning and know this family will have some sort of relief just before the holiday , " said the Rev. Henry Brown , of Mothers United Against Violence .
" This is truly something to be thankful for . " NEWLINE
Brown 's anti - violence organization held a rally Saturday on the steps of city hall , calling for the community to help in bringing the men responsible for Ariana 's shooting to justice . NEWLINE
And though he expressed the " utmost gratitude " to the police for their efforts in pursuing the case , he had a stern message for the citizens of Hartford . NEWLINE
" As long as we stay silent , these senseless acts will keep happening in our neighborhoods , " he said .
" We ca n't rely on police to be everywhere at one time .
We have to start policing ourselves . "
