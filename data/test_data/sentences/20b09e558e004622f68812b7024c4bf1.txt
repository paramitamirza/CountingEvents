A nearby resident described the scene Wednesday as it unfolded the night before . NEWLINE
" I was at home in my living room when I counted about 15 or 16 bangs â€“ repeated bangs .
They were very evenly placed , " said Mike , a resident who lives about a block away from where the shootings took place , and who asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution .
" There are people lighting off fireworks in this neighborhood .
You hear things at night and I 've heard gunshots before .
The relatively slow pace told me they were not firecrackers .
It was too even . " NEWLINE
" It 's disturbing because I live here with my kids , " said Mike , who said he has four children ages 7 and younger .
" I know there are lots of kids in the neighborhood around me .
Over time I hear something like that , I wonder whose kid could have gotten hurt just now .
I feel very helpless in terms of how to stop this from happening . " NEWLINE

Mike said he 's cautious about when and where he lets his children play outside , and that last night 's incident marked the third or fourth time he 's heard gunshots in the neighborhood in recent years . NEWLINE
" It 's not the first time it 's happened in that general vicinity and it is frightening , " he said .
" I love my neighbors .
I know it 's not the locals doing this .
I have a strong suspicion based on what I 've read about these things that it 's very likely outside elements that come through to cause trouble . " NEWLINE
Mike said he 'd like to see more police surveillance cameras in the area , particularly around nearby Foster Park . NEWLINE
" I certainly do n't believe in a police state , but I also feel like a proper set of eyes on the area could prevent things like this , " he said . NEWLINE
