Brown , who discharged the .22 caliber rifle himself , was spending the night at a friend ’s apartment in the 5600 block of Shallow Run when the two boys began “
carelessly ” playing with the gun , Benbrook police Commander David Babcock said . NEWLINE
The boys had handled the same weapon two weeks ago , but since it didn’t fire , they didn’t think it worked , Babcock said . NEWLINE “
From that point on , they didn’t think it would go off , ” Babcock said .
“
It was just juveniles being juveniles .
The guys were best friends .
There were no hostile intentions .
