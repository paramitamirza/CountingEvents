The other three were taken to local hospitals , with one in critical condition and the other two in stable condition .
A family member at the scene said Jackson had an infant son .
His aunt said he had just celebrated his son 's first birthday on Saturday .
She hopes that someone will step forward , even anonymously , and provide police with information as to what happened to her nephew."At the end of the day all we can do is pray that someone sit here and say something .
Because this does n't make any sense - here is another child ( who is ) fatherless , for what ?
It just does n't make sense , " she said .
Witnesses at the scene said as many as 20 people were at a house party drinking before the shooting occurred .
