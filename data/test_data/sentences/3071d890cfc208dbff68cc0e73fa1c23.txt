By : Mike Rutledge - Staff Writer NEWLINE Andrew Little , the 8-year - old Fairfield Twp .
boy who wished for enough Christmas cards to decorate his room at St. Joseph Home in Sharonville , got his wish , many times over . NEWLINE
As of late Tuesday morning , Little had received an estimated 50,000 pieces of mail .
And that ’s before an anticipated second wave of cards from Asia and Europe , his grandmother , Alyson Little , said . NEWLINE
If cards keep appearing — none have yet arrived from other continents , where there was news coverage last week — young Mr. Little may have enough cards to fill every seat of Paul Brown Stadium , which has a capacity of 65,535 and is where his two favorite Bengals , A.J. Green and Andrew Whitworth , play .
He ’s already eclipsed Great American Ballpark , which has a capacity for 42,319 . NEWLINE
Alyson Little is guessing her grandson will have as many cards as Green and Whitworth have fans on a given Sunday , “ because the mailman said the mail ’s still going to keep rolling in for a week , ” she said .
“ Plus , with it being picked up in the Asian markets — Japan , and China — and Europe…. ” NEWLINE “ Can you tell everybody from the bottom of my heart , how grateful I am ?
” asked Alyson Little , who spent $ 30 to spread the word on Facebook , hoping Andrew would receive dozens of cards , more than the four he got last year .
Then this media outlet reported the story . NEWLINE
Thanks to all the cards and everything , it was wonderful , ” this Christmas , Alyson Little said .
“ It ’s unbelievable .
I still have two carloads of cards to take over today .
This is epic , and we’re elated , ” said the grandmother of Andrew , who at about age 15 months contracted a rapid onset of transverse myelitis , a swelling of the spinal cord , which paralyzed him from the neck down .
Andrew proved wrong doctors’ predictions that he would live only a week after the disease ’s onset , and has developed into a clever boy with a good vocabulary who attends second grade at Evendale Elementary School . NEWLINE
“ Between UPS , FedEx and the post office , we’re well over 50,000 , ” Alyson Little said .
“ It is unbelievable .
We had to move everything to my husband ’s warehouse .
It ’s about a 20,000-square - foot warehouse , and I bet you
it takes up every bit of 1,000 feet .
It ’s one big bay .
It is just unbelievable — and there ’s more still coming in .
Early last week , the mail started arriving non - stop , she said . NEWLINE
My hat goes off to my postman , because he was at my house two or three times a day , ” she said .
“ I’ve got to tell you : The postal service really came through .
Grandma says Andrew is such a sweet boy .
He wants me to send everybody thank - you cards , and he wants to write to all these people .
He has 50,000 new friends , and he ’s going just gaga .
He loves it .
She has shown him photos of the piles of cards , but Andrew doesn’t understand the gravity of the overwhelming response , she said . NEWLINE
“ I show him pictures , and he ’s like , ‘
You brought ‘
em , right ?
You brought me all my cards?’ ” she said .
I was just over there yesterday , and he goes , ‘ OK , Grandma , lay it on me .
Where ’s my cards?’ It would take a semi truck .
On Friday , her postal carrier said the number of cards was at 50,000 NEWLINE ‘ “ I know , because I have to scan them,’
” she said the postal carrier told her . NEWLINE
Gradually , Andrew will get all his cards , she said . NEWLINE
This Christmas is “ truly , the best he ’s ever had , ” she said .
“ Being thankful , and saying thanks , it would never be enough .
I’m very humbled and grateful .
Thank you doesn’t even begin to cut it….
But we’re very grateful .
Everybody really went out of their way and over the top for him .
I could never repay what everyone ’s done for him .
Alyson had hoped to decorate all the walls of Andrew ’s room in Sharonville , but that plan has been delayed because of an outbreak of illness there , she said .
Patients are being contained in their living areas , and Andrew has been unable to visit friends there yet to share the cards . NEWLINE
But she plans to string hundreds at a time in front of a wooden cabinet in a common area for when the illnesses subside , she said , so patients and their guests can enjoy them . NEWLINE
These are his friends , and he ’s so excited , ” Alyson said . “
He ’s like , ‘
Are they coming for my birthday party?’
He doesn’t understand 50,000 .
Grandma has heard from media outlets in Japan , which emailed and called her last week . NEWLINE
“ Couldn’t really understand what they were saying , ”
she noted , with a laugh .
I know the story ran in Japan , and I know it ran in Europe , because I had newspapers from Germany , France and Austria get in touch with me .
Andrew also got another unexpected surprise : Lemon Grenade Creative in Hamilton took him , a Star Wars fan , and his family to see the new movie , Rogue One . NEWLINE
They made his day , ”
Alyson Little said . NEWLINE
After seeing the latest film , Andrew announced that with the sounds from his ventilator , “ I sound like Darth Vader , ” she said . NEWLINE
