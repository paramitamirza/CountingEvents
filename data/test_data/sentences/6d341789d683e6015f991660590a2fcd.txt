I just accidentally shot my friend , ” the 15-year - old friend told dispatchers .
“ We were shooting guns , and I forgot there was a shell in the chamber .

It hit Fluty in the back from between six and nine feet away , deputies said . NEWLINE
There were no adults home at the time , according to investigators . NEWLINE
Fluty ’s grandmother , Carleen Fluty , said she happened to be listening to a police scanner at her home when she heard the dispatch . NEWLINE

Obviously it was an accident , ” she said .
“ I don’t even know the full details , but I’m a wreck . ” NEWLINE
Erie County Sheriff Paul Sigsworth said detectives met with officials from the Erie County Prosecutor ’s Office , but a decision on potential charges will not be made until the investigation is completed . NEWLINE
“ First of all , we have to make every determination we can that it was purely accidental .
It certainly appears to be at this time , but we have not been able to get a good detailed statement from the victim , ” Sigsworth said . NEWLINE

Weapons should always be secured within the household , ” he said .
These guns were not secured within the household .
They were accessible to these boys and this is the tragic result .
