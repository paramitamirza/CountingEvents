According to the Hilliard Police the circumstances are still being investigated .
We are all deeply saddened by this event .
Please take this opportunity to inform your student about this situation and share any information about your family ’s personal beliefs and preferences related to Colin ’s passing .
Death is a difficult topic for many adults and also children handle this stress in a variety of ways .
It is natural for them to ask questions or to display behaviors such as : · clinging close to adults ; · displaying regressive behaviors ; · repetitively re - enacting the event in play activities ; · appearing not to be affected ; · thinking about it privately ; · appearing frightened , agitated or angry ; · experiencing difficulty sleeping ; and , · complaining of stomachaches or not feeling well .
It is important to listen to your child , help them understand what has happened and return to normal every day activities .
We are currently working out details to support students , staff and families during this difficult time .
We will have counselors available should students or staff need additional support .
While each of us will handle this news in a different manner , it is important that we are supportive of each other as we return to a normal routine .
