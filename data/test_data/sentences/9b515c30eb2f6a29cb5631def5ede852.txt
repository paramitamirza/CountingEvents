" We have again , two kids , you have an old woman , do the right thing .

All three of the victims were taken to a hospital , where they are expected to be OK. NEWLINE What happened is still fresh on the minds of many , like Rochelle Smith , who got a call the Sunday morning from a family member in the area telling her what happened . NEWLINE
" I was like , ' Oh my goodness .
What are they doing ? ' "
resident Rochelle Smith said . NEWLINE
" Whatever beef he had , he knew who he was shooting at .
He just could n't shoot , and we 're fortunate that these people did n't suffer a more catastrophic injury , " Moses said . NEWLINE
The shooting happened here at Latrobe Homes in the set of residences just behind me , and then the police believe the suspect took off running west . NEWLINE
Detectives are now doing what they can to find the shooter .
Police said the gunman is probably in his early teens and is from the Latrobe Homes area . NEWLINE
" They were knocking on doors , combing through grass as you guys saw , and from what I saw and from what I understand they 've reviewed some video footage that was taken in the area , " Moses said . NEWLINE
For some , it 's a violent reminder of how quickly things can change . NEWLINE
" It 's horrible and it 's scary , but we just keep on living , " Smith said .

Regardless of what happens , we just got to keep caring about each other and keep checking on each other . " NEWLINE
