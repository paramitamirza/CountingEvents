The shooting happened near North Lindbergh and left the highway closed for several hours . NEWLINE
The Major Case Squad was activated by Hazelwood Police , Sunday , to begin looking into the incident , which may have ties to a Sauget carjacking and a night spot in Hazelwood within sight of the interchange where the victims appear to have entered the highway . NEWLINE
“ We have found evidence on the highway .
We have found some spent gunshot shells on the highway , ” Hazelwood Police Major Ken Jewson said , regarding the need to divert traffic off 270 . NEWLINE
Police say the victims had been at Jay ’s Classic Bar and Grill prior to the shooting .
