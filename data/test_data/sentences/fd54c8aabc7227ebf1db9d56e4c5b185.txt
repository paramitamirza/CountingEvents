Hunter Takes Responsibility After Accidentally Shooting Himself While Testing Ice
WORCESTER ( CBS ) –
Hunter Richardson was enjoying his holiday break back home in Orange after his first semester at Keene State . NEWLINE
But he spent Christmas — and the days since — lying motionless in the Intensive Care Unit at UMass Memorial Hospital in Worcester with his family at his bedside . NEWLINE
It ’s horrible , ” says his mother Lee Anna Richardson with tears streaming down her cheek .
There ’s really no other way to say it .
The 18-year - old went out deer hunting on Christmas Eve with his father , younger brother , and cousin – in the woods off Tully Road near the Athol line . NEWLINE
That ’s where Hunter smacked his rifle butt on an icy pond to see how thick enough to support his weight .
But the muzzleloader fired — ripping into his chest . NEWLINE
“ I never in a gazillion years thought I’d be in the ICU with my son , ” says his Mom , “ hoping he’d just survive .
His dad — a retired Marine — stopped the teen ’s bleeding out in those woods , and a stranger at a nearby tree nursery used his tractor to clear a path for first responders . NEWLINE
Fortunately , the bullet missed Hunter ’s heart and a major artery , but it tore through his left lung and shattered his shoulder blade . NEWLINE
Doctors haven’t yet decided if they should try to remove the bullet fragments .
That’ll come later . NEWLINE “
You survive off of everybody ’s prayers and love , ” his mother says . NEWLINE
And there ’s been plenty of that .
Friends have ferried in meals as the Richardson ’s keep a ’round the clock vigil at the hospital . NEWLINE
But the family has also been stung by the online venom of some people who have sarcastically jabbed Hunter for his lapse in judgment — even though the teen has owned it from the start . NEWLINE
“ Before he was sedated , he said he took responsibility for it , ” Lee Anna Richhardson laments .
It was his fault .
He screwed up .
That doesn’t mean he ’s a bad person or irresponsible .
He just made a mistake .
State Environmental Police point to the incident as a somber reminder for all hunters to always make sure the muzzle of their rifles is pointed in a safe direction . NEWLINE
Now , Lee Anna Richardson says she’d much rather focus on her son ’s recovery , and the GoFundMe page aimed at helping out with the mounting medical bills . NEWLINE “
If you would be kind enough to donate that would be wonderful , ” she says .
If not , a prayer works just as well .
At this point , it ’s baby steps for Hunter , as he faces at least two weeks in the ICU — and a long recovery .
