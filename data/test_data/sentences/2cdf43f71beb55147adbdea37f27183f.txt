Transgender Woman Files Federal Lawsuit Against Seattle Blood Clinic For Sex Discrimination
A transgender woman has filed a federal suit against Bloodworks Northwest , formerly known as Puget Sound Blood Center , a Seattle - based blood clinic , for terminating her employment on the basis of sex .
The complaint , filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle , alleges that the clinic fired Stephanie Binschus from her position as a blood collection specialist in February of 2014 using the specious justification that she had falsified documentation in the clinic ’s donor database by stating that she is female .
She had worked at the clinic since October of 2013 . NEWLINE
According to her complaint , Ms. Binschus had been a long - time blood donor at the Center .
She completed her transition before her employment there , and her supervisors were aware that she had been issued a Washington State birth certificate that recognised her as female .
Ms. Binschus’ job duties as a blood collection specialist included making entries on the donor database and she was permitted to change inaccurate entries to the database .
She noticed her own clinic donor record still designated her as male .
After the clinic changed its policy to permit donors to self - identify at the first stage of the donor process , she updated her own record to correct the inaccuracy , and to accurately reflect her female status .
Other employees had also made changes to their own database information without being terminated .
But immediately after she made the change , Binschus was singled out , subjected to a superficial investigation , in which she was not interviewed by her supervisors or human resources to find out her side of the story , and subsequently fired for “ falsification of documentation .

The lawsuit alleges that less than two months prior to her termination , Binschus ’s supervisors had suggested that her transgender identity was too “ controversial ” to be welcome at the clinic .
One supervisor advised that she was not allowed to have a transgender - focused college library book with her at work or pamphlets with “ transgender information ” because the supervisor considered them “ controversial materials .
That same supervisor criticised Ms. Binschus for allowing her advocacy for transgender issues to interfere with her work or the workplace environment .
Yet another supervisor referred to Ms. Binschus as “ his/her ” in an email at the time of her termination . NEWLINE
It ’s very clear that Bloodworks Northwest did not truly understand that Ms. Binschus is a woman , ” said Jillian T. Weiss , Ms. Binschus ’s attorney , who represents her along with J. Denise Diskin of Seattle ’s Teller & Associates PLLC. “
The anti - transgender office climate engendered by supervisors reveals that the clinic believed that Ms. Binschus ’s statement that she is female was false .
The clinic terminated her on the basis of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibits unlawful sex discrimination .
Sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of gender and gender identity .
Gender identity refers to characteristics related to a person ’s internal sense of gender , being male , female , or other .
It is generally accepted in the medical field that gender identity is intractably rooted in the psyche at a very young age , and can not be changed .
The State of Washington permits people to submit documentation from a physician to request recognition of their sex on a state birth certificate . NEWLINE
The lawsuit asks the court to rule that Bloodworks Northwest be directed to stop subjecting employees to sex discrimination ( including on the basis of gender , gender identity , gender expression , gender transition , and sex stereotypes ) , institute new policies and train its employees , and compensate Ms. Binschus for the monetary damages she suffered , such as lost income . NEWLINE
This case sends a very strong message : transgender employees should never face discrimination for being who they are .
Weiss said .
Bloodworks
Northwest is a very important community organisation with a very important mission — saving lives through blood donation .
It is with great regret that we feel constrained to bring a lawsuit against a life - saving non - profit organisation .
Nonetheless , no one is above the law .
Bloodworks Northwest violated Ms. Binschus ’s federal civil rights by failing to respect her gender and firing her for saying she is female .
It is time for the company to right this wrong and ensure this never happens to other transgender employees . ”
