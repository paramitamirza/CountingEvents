( Photo : Facebook ) NEWLINE Dearborn Heights — A Dearborn Heights man suspected in the quadruple homicide of his family
Wednesday allegedly bound and assaulted his wife before making her watch him fatally shoot her two older children , according to the Wayne County Prosecutor ’s Office . NEWLINE
Gregory Vincente Green , 49 , also is suspected of killing his two young daughters with carbon - monoxide poisoning , officials said . NEWLINE
Green was arraigned Thursday in 20th District Court where he told Judge David Turfe he understood the charges against him and said “
I don’t need bond .
Bond was denied . NEWLINE
He was brought into court barefoot and shackled at the feet and handcuffed .
A muscular man , Green was arraigned in the courtroom under heavy security .
He mostly kept his head bowed during the brief court hearing . NEWLINE
Green is charged with four counts of first - degree murder and one count each of assault with intent to do great bodily harm , torture , unlawful imprisonment , felonious assault as a felon in possession and felony firearm . NEWLINE
The alleged evidence in this case will show an appalling level of domestic violence that was cataclysmic , ” Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement announcing the charges Thursday . NEWLINE
Green allegedly called 911 around 1:15 a.m. Wednesday and waited for police in the driveway of his home on the 4400 block of Hipp in Dearborn Heights .
Inside the home , investigators discovered 39-year - old Faith Green in the basement , bound with duct tape and zip ties . NEWLINE
It is alleged that Green bound his wife , cut her face with a box cutter and shot her foot and then shot the two older children in front of her , ” prosecuting officials said .
Mrs. Green was taken to a local hospital for treatment .
Dearborn Heights Police Captain Michael Petri said there is no record of previous domestic runs to the Green home or “ any knowledge ” about the wife filing a personal protection order against her husband . NEWLINE
Faith Green had filed a PPO in Wayne County Circuit Court against her husband in February 2013 , but it was rejected by Judge Deborah Ross Adams on the basis that there was “ insufficient allegations for a PPO at this time .
Efforts to reach the judge , who was removed from office in June 2013 for judicial misconduct involving her own divorce case , were unsuccessful Thursday . NEWLINE
Faith Green said in her filing that she had not filed a complaint with the Dearborn Heights Police Department but “
I plan to file a report after work .
She also wrote : “
I didn’t want to leave my house and not be able to get back in . ” NEWLINE
There is no indication in the protection order request that Green had been imprisoned for killing his first wife . NEWLINE
Local attorney Arnold Reed said it is the responsibility of the individual seeking a PPO to provide the evidence against the person from whom they are seeking protection .
Judges do not order an investigation of the person who the PPO is filed against . NEWLINE
Reed also suggested that if the judge had known Green ’s past criminal record it would have had an impact on her decision . NEWLINE
Petri said after the court hearing Thursday that what Green is accused of doing defies logic . NEWLINE “
As a father of three children ... the thought that you could do something like that to your own children has no correlation to any reason in my mind , ” Petri said .
You’re angry . ... You’re just in disbelief but that has no relevance in our investigation .
The suspect ’s stepchildren , identified by prosecutors as Chadney Allen , 19 , and Kara Allen , 17 , each had multiple gunshot wounds and were pronounced dead at the scene .
Their deaths have been ruled homicides by the Wayne County Medical Examiner . NEWLINE
Duct tape was found on the muffler of a car in the garage with a tube attached to a car in the garage , according to officials .
Police later found Green ’s younger daughters , Koi Green , 5 , and Kaliegh Green , 4 , in an “ upper portion of the home .
“ It is alleged that Green poisoned the two younger children with carbon monoxide , ” officials said .
“ The children were taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead . ” NEWLINE
A GoFundMe page was set up Thursday to raise $ 50,000 to help the family bury the children .
A message attributed to the family read : “ Words can not describe the horrific tragedy our family is experiencing over the untimely deaths of Chadney , Kara , Koi , and Kaleigh .
There is no way that a mother could fathom laying to rest one child , let alone all four of her children at once without life insurance .
Meanwhile , the string of charges came more than two decades after Green was imprisoned for killing his previous , then - pregnant wife , according to the Michigan Department of Corrections . NEWLINE
In that case , Green also called police after he fatally stabbed Tonya Green , who was six months pregnant .
The attack also killed the unborn child . NEWLINE
Green pleaded no contest to second - degree murder and was sentenced to 15 - 25 years in prison .
He was released in 2008 after 16 years in prison and after his fifth attempt at parole . NEWLINE
No letters of opposition to his parole were filed before Green was released from prison , Gautz told The Associated Press .
Had Green not won parole in 2008 , he likely would have been releases from prison in 2012 because of credits for good behavior , he said . NEWLINE
Green married Faith Green about two years after his prison release in 2010 , records show .
The two were embroiled in a divorce , filed by Faith Green on Oct. 11 , 2013 , and again this past Aug. 11 . NEWLINE
Thursday , a memorial of candles , stuffed animals and balloons graced the one - story home in the 4400 block of Hipp near Pelham and Annapolis in Dearborn Heights .
Neighbors looked sadly as passersby drove past the house . NEWLINE
Jim Goudie , a longtime resident of the area , left a small stuffed animal as he expressed his sadness : “
This is the worst thing that has ever happened here .
