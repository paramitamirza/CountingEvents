After she was shot on Easter Sunday while coming home from the park , a girl grabbed neighbor Rita Lewis and begged , " ' Please do n't let me die .
I 'm only 11 years old .
Do n't let me die . ' " NEWLINE
The girl , later identified as Tymisha Washington , was one of five children between the ages of 11 and 15 hospitalized in the shooting Sunday , a tragedy that devastated relatives of the victims and drew an emotional response from Mayor Rahm Emanuel Monday . NEWLINE
" They just lit them kids up , " Lewis said of the occupants of a car who shot at the children in the 6600 block of South Michigan Ave . NEWLINE
Lewis , 53 , was outside because her six grandchildren , including a 3-year - old boy and 11-year - old girl , had just started heading home from the park near Brownell Elementary School when the shooting started . NEWLINE
The occupants of a light - colored car approached and fired shots at another group of children who were standing near East Marquette Road and South Michigan Avenue about 7:38 p.m. , said Officer Jose Estrada , a Chicago Police Department spokesman . NEWLINE
As the shots rang out , Lewis said she ran from her porch and " threw " her 3-year - old and 5-year - old grandchildren onto her porch .
The shots struck a group of children walking behind them on the block . NEWLINE
The shooters " must 've rolled down the window and said something because all the kids started hollering , ' No , no , no ! '
then you heard , ' Pow , pow , pow , pow ' , " she said Monday , as she closed her left eye and curled her index finger to simulate pulling a trigger . NEWLINE
Police said whoever was in the car asked the children if they had any gang affiliation before firing the shots .
The number of shooters and the type of gun used in the shooting was unclear , Estrada said . NEWLINE
As Lewis ' grandchildren ran into the house , they told her a friend of the family had been shot .
Lewis said Tymisha grabbed her as she approached her , screaming in pain as she held on to a fence a few houses down . NEWLINE
" ' Please do n't let me die .
I 'm only 11 years old .
Do n't let me die , '
" Washington pleaded to her , Lewis recalled . NEWLINE
A man handed over his yellow polo , and Lewis used it apply pressure as blood spurted from the girl 's wound .
Lewis begged the 11-year - old to remain calm as Lewis ' hand cramped up from applying pressure to the wound . NEWLINE
Lewis said she looked up and saw a 14-year - old girl standing above them in a panic , unaware that she , too , had been shot .
A 14-year - old boy lying against a car also had suffered a bullet wound . NEWLINE
" ' We 've got four kids shot here .
We need an ambulance , we need police , we need everything , ' " Lewis ' daughter , Jennifer , recalled pleading with a dispatcher Sunday night . NEWLINE
Tymisha was the most seriously injured and taken to Stroger in critical condition , along with a 15-year - old girl in serious condition .
The boy was taken to Comer Children 's Hospital in serious condition along with the 14-year - old girl , identified as Alice Terry by family .
She was in critical condition . NEWLINE
Later , a 14-year - old girl walked into St. Bernard Hospital with a graze wound in the buttocks from the same shooting .
She was in stable condition , police said . NEWLINE
Residents of the block on Monday recounted the devastating drive - by shooting from the night before .
Blood stained the sidewalk where the shots rang out .
The trail of blood led through a gate to the corner house on the block and ended at its side door . NEWLINE
Farther down the block , a large pool of blood could be seen in front of the gate of Jessica Terry 's home .
Through the black gate , cardboard cutouts of an Easter bunny remained in the grass from a celebration the day before . NEWLINE
Jessica Terry , 20 , said her cousin Alice , 14 , was returning home from the park with the group when they got caught in the crossfire .
Terry said none of the victims were residents of the block ; her cousin was only visiting for the holiday . NEWLINE
" I 'm traumatized .
My kids are traumatized .
She was an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire .
It does n't make sense you can ride up on kids and shoot them for nothing , " Terry said .
" We need to leave Chicago .
...
It 's bad . " NEWLINE
Jennifer Lewis also said she 's not sure she 'll bring her kids back to the city . NEWLINE
" When you have an 11-year - old , and you seen an 11-year - old shot right in front of you , it 's the worst feeling in the world , " she said , rounding up her children for the trip back to their home in DeKalb . NEWLINE
" I broke down in the shower and cried after .
Had they stayed out one minute longer they could 've been shot , " she said of her own children .
" My kids are terrified . " NEWLINE
Her youngest son , Jaden , 3 , stood barefoot on the porch Monday , his mouth red from drinking pop .
His grandmother had forced him to take off the shirt he was wearing the night before .
It had been stained with blood after the shooting . NEWLINE
" My tummy hurts , " the boy said , poking his index finger into his stomach .
" I 've been shot . " NEWLINE
" He 's been saying it all night .
He 's convinced he 's been shot , " his grandmother said . NEWLINE
