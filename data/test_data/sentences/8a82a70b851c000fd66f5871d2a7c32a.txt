" Everybody in this universe knows that Detroit has an issue , " said Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy at a Wednesday news conference .
" Detroit and Wayne County have huge issues with children dying from firearm use .
And no matter how much we sugarcoat it or say it ’s not so or try to cover it up with stats about crime going down , it still remains an issue that we have to address . " NEWLINE

According to the prosecutor 's office , Drewery 's 4-year - old son found a handgun that belonged to his great - grandfather and shot himself with it in the 1400 block of Terry Street .
Worthy said the mother and great - grandfather allegedly knew the unsecured handgun was in the home and accessible to the boy and his younger brother . NEWLINE
In Wayne County alone , in the last 17 months , Worthy said eight children have killed or injured themselves or others with unsecured firearms .
Since 2005 , 14 cases involving the shooting deaths or injuries of children who found unsecured guns have been prosecuted by the Wayne County Prosecutor 's Office , according to data released today . NEWLINE
" This is a public health issue and not just a crime issue , " Worthy said .
"
As I’ve said often.l these guns are legally owned .
They’re often unsecured and most of the time
, children know where they are even if parents think that they don’t .
And all of this is totally , completely and absolutely preventable . " NEWLINE
The announcement of charges follows a recent string of fatal shootings within the past two months that involved children .
The first was on Easter , March 27 , when 3-year - old Aniaya Montgomery was shot and killed on the city ’s west side . NEWLINE
Then on April 17 , 6-month old Miracle Murray was killed as shots were fired at a house on Winthrop near Clarita , also on Detroit 's west side .
Police said at the time they believed Miracle 's slaying was connected to Aniaya 's killing . NEWLINE
And on April 24 , a 4-year - old boy was shot and injured while riding a bicycle , and his father was shot and killed in the same shooting . NEWLINE
On May 8 , a 9-year - old boy found a handgun in a neighbor ’s yard and accidentally shot himself on the city 's west side while showing the gun to his mother .
The boy was taken to a hospital .
The boy was one of several injured in a bloody Mother 's Day weekend in Detroit that left seven people dead and 14 others hurt in 17 shootings across the city . NEWLINE
Two weeks ago , Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy condemned the string of child shootings in a statement to the Free Press , calling them an " epidemic " that must be addressed . NEWLINE
" How many more deaths do we need before strong , swift action is taken ? "
Worthy said , at the time . NEWLINE •
Rochelle Riley : Detroit does n't need protests , it needs to protect its children NEWLINE Wednesday
, Worthy called the shootings " troubling " and urged parents and caretakers to become more responsible .
Worthy said she plans to call for stricter legislation aimed at gun owners who leave their firearms around a child who subsequently injures or kills themselves or others .
Worthy said she 's also planning to meet with the heads of hospitals across Wayne County to discuss how pediatricians can better educate parents about gun ownership . NEWLINE
" Make sure they’re ( guns ) unloaded and secured and please don’t think that your child doesn’t know you have a gun and number two , doesn’t know where it is , " Worthy said .
" It ’s just about being responsible .
...
There are some people who would say , ' Why are you charging someone who 's 80 years old ?
Why are you charging grandparents who are 65 years old ? '
The victims in these cases , those who did not have the good luck to survive , they won’t reach their 5th birthday , their 10th birthday , let alone their 80th birthday .
We just have to be responsible when we decide to adopt , bear or look after children .
We have to know what ’s in our homes . " NEWLINE
