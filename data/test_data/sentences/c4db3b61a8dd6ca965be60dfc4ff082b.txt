Follow CBSMIAMI.COM : Facebook | Twitter NEWLINE MIAMI ( CBSMiami ) — An 8-year - old girl has died and her father is listed in critical condition after they were shot outside of a home in Miami . NEWLINE
It happened at N.W. 25th Avenue & 102nd Street as neighbors said they heard several shots ring out in the middle of a quiet Sunday afternoon . NEWLINE
Police said at least two men in a 4-door black Ford Fusion , or Ford Focus - type , rolled by and began shooting at the man as he exited his white Jeep . NEWLINE
Investigators believe that 32-year - old father was the intended target — but not his daughter , who was on their home ’s porch just feet away . NEWLINE
The child that was standing near the front door of the house took a round to the head , ” said Miami - Dade Police Director Juan Perez .
And it pains me to be here once again speaking about a small child , an innocent child , that has nothing to do with any criminal activity , has nothing to do with ongoing disputes and took a bullet that was not intended for her .
” NEWLINE Residents were sitting on their patio relaxing , with their children playing in the yard , when they heard the barrage of gunfire . NEWLINE
“ Imagine you hear these gunshots where you live , ” wondered one neighbor .
Can you imagine if they got shot ? ” NEWLINE
As soon as we heard the gunshots , we ran inside , ” said his friend . NEWLINE
At the hospital , loved ones waited anxiously for news and prayed for the little girl and her father .
By nightfall , a relative told CBS4 ’s Donna Rapado that the child had died . NEWLINE
“ We feel the same way you guys feel , and the rest of this community , ” Perez added .
“ We’re in awe that this happened .
These tragic events need to stop .
Look around , there ’s neighbors standing out here , kids playing in the front yard .
Just like the child that was hit .
Those bullets could’ve gone anywhere .
Senseless violence within our community .
It ’s been a quiet summer .
And now as school starts , we’re gonna start up again .
This is ridiculous .
” NEWLINE
