4 Wounded In Oakland Drive - By Shooting Of Party Bus Near Bay Bridge
OAKLAND ( CBS/AP ) —
Gunmen fired shots into a moving party bus in West Oakland early Saturday , wounding four and leaving authorities stumped because passengers refused to cooperate with the investigation . NEWLINE
The chartered executive limo bus was leaving San Francisco and had exited the Bay Bridge around 2:25 a.m. and was on the eastbound Interstate Highway 80 transition to southbound Interstate 880 when two gunmen in a red SUV drove alongside and opened fire , said California Highway Patrol Officer Daniel Hill . NEWLINE
A fourth passenger sustained was hurt critically but was stable and is expected to survive .
Three others had minor injuries . NEWLINE
Interstate 880 was closed for roughly five hours as officers investigated . NEWLINE
Passengers adamantly refused to give witness statements or provide descriptions of the shooters , authorities said . NEWLINE
“
In fact , they didn’t cooperate so much that one of our officers got assaulted and kicked by one of the victims , ” Hill said . NEWLINE
A female victim hit by a ricochet also got into an altercation with emergency medical personnel and forced her way out of an ambulance .
She fled and her whereabouts are unknown . NEWLINE
Investigators say the bus was occupied by couples but Hill could not provide an estimate of how many people were on the bus .
He declined to release names and ages of the wounded . NEWLINE
“ I will say we don’t believe this is a random incident , ” he said . NEWLINE
The incident is the eighth freeway shooting in the East Bay since November .
Officers have blamed the shootings on an escalating gang war in the Richmond area where six of the shootings have taken place . NEWLINE
Freeways are appealing because there are fewer surveillance cameras and easy getaways . NEWLINE
Hill said the CHP does not believe Saturday ’s shootout is specifically related to the other freeway shootings . NEWLINE
