By Steve Slater and Alex Chambers NEWLINE LONDON , Sept 8 ( Reuters ) -
A former Citigroup foreign NEWLINE exchange trader claiming unfair dismissal after a currency NEWLINE rigging scandal told a London court on Tuesday that the NEWLINE activities for which he was fired were common practice at the NEWLINE U.S. bank at that time . NEWLINE
Perry Stimpson , dismissed from Citigroup 's London desk last NEWLINE November in the wake of a scandal that resulted in banks paying NEWLINE billions of dollars in fines , told the East London employment NEWLINE tribunal that he wanted to set the record straight and repair NEWLINE his reputation . NEWLINE
In a filing to the court , Citi said that Stimpson was NEWLINE dismissed for serious breach of contract , alleging that he NEWLINE appeared to have shared confidential client information with NEWLINE traders at other banks via electronic chatrooms . NEWLINE
Citi said Stimpson also took " steps to deliberately conceal NEWLINE such disclosures " . NEWLINE
Stimpson , who is representing himself , said : " I 'm not here NEWLINE to mud - sling , I 'm here to ensure the truth about foreign NEWLINE exchange at Citigroup is heard once and for all . " NEWLINE
Industry sources have said the case could be the first of NEWLINE many claims by traders fired over allegations of misconduct in NEWLINE the $ 5.3 trillion - a - day foreign exchange market . NEWLINE
" I 'm trying to paint a picture of the bank at the time and NEWLINE why my actions were normal across the industry and at the NEWLINE respondent ( Citi ) ...
It shows the information - sharing practices NEWLINE that I have been criticised for was a common practice , " Stimpson NEWLINE told the packed hearing at the start of a case scheduled to last NEWLINE four days . NEWLINE
Employment tribunal judge Alison Russell ruled that there NEWLINE would be no reporting restrictions on the naming of Citigroup NEWLINE staff mentioned during proceedings .
She also ruled that NEWLINE Stimpson 's case would not be rolled together with those of three NEWLINE other former Citigroup forex traders scheduled to be heard in NEWLINE the coming weeks . NEWLINE
A lawyer for Citigroup , Diya Sen Gupta , had told the hearing NEWLINE that it would be " contrary to the interests of justice " if other NEWLINE Citi staff were named without having had a chance to respond to NEWLINE allegations . NEWLINE
Stimpson said at the hearing that it would be unfair to NEWLINE allow senior Citi staff to remain anonymous . NEWLINE
" My dismissal has been a very public affair , " he said . NEWLINE
" Senior management -- responsible for a lack of controls -- have NEWLINE been afforded complete anonymity .
I would see that as unfair . " NEWLINE
