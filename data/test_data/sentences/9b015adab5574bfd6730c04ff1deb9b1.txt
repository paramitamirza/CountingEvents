The shotgun went off , hurting a 9-year - old boy . NEWLINE
It happened Friday night at an apartment complex on Saginaw 's southeast side . NEWLINE
The shotgun may have been disposed of by men who lead police on a chase three weeks ago .
That was until a group of six or seven children found it . NEWLINE
" They all shook up about it , it 's sad , " said Kiesha Thomas , of Saginaw . NEWLINE
The group of young children were playing in the area of the Bridgton Place Townhomes on the southeast side of Saginaw , Friday evening .
Eight - year - old Davontae Carter was part of that group , along with friends and his 9-year - old brother . NEWLINE
Davontae 's mother gave us permission to speak with the child .
He says the kids were in hot pursuit of a snake in some weeds . NEWLINE
" We were about to find a snake , but then we found a gun , " Davontae said .
" It was a shotgun . " NEWLINE
Davontae says one of his friends was holding the gun when it accidentally went off .
Davontae 's 9-year - old brother was wounded in the arm . NEWLINE

He is expected to be released on Tuesday . NEWLINE
" Kid going through something like that , with such a big gun , that 's sad , " Thomas said . NEWLINE
Thomas , Davontae 's aunt , says there was a police chase in the complex back on June 24 .
Police say the chase stemmed from a shooting incident on the west side of the city and ended in the complex .
Two men were arrested , but no gun was found .
Police say it 's possible the gun was thrown out of the car as the chase was coming to an end . NEWLINE
Thomas thinks management of the complex should have alerted residents to the potential threat . NEWLINE
" They could have put a note on the door , '
Well it 's suspicious
, we had a chase out here , there might be a gun laying around out here , watch your kids , keep a close eye on your kids , ' "
