RBS trader fired in currency probe wins unfair dismissal tribunal
Ian Drysdale was fired for plotting with members of the “ Cartel ” chat group and sharing secret client orders with contacts at rival lenders , according to testimony from the bank ’s executives during the trial at a specialist employment tribunal . NEWLINE
“
He , along with a number of others , was doing something he knew was fundamentally wrong , ” Judge James Tayler said in a ruling dated Dec. 7 .
While serious procedural failings by RBS made the dismissal technically unfair , “ it is not just and equitable that he receive compensation .
” NEWLINE
Bloomberg reports that six banks paid a total of $ 4.3 billion in penalties to global regulators to settle a probe into allegations they colluded to fix benchmarks used to value currencies , with Edinburgh - based RBS paying $ 634 million for its role .
As part of the 2014 settlement , officials released transcripts from online chat rooms where traders calling themselves “ the 3 musketeers ” and “ the A - team ” shared client orders and attempted to manipulate rates . NEWLINE
“ We are pleased that the tribunal has ruled that Ian Drysdale ’s conduct and behavior was completely unacceptable in a number of different ways and that no compensation will be payable to him , ” RBS said in a statement . NEWLINE
Carol Davis , a lawyer for Drysdale , didn’t immediately respond to an e - mail and phone call seeking comment .
The trader sued RBS saying there was no evidence he “ maliciously ” breached its policies and he was given no formal training on what constituted confidential information . NEWLINE
Judge Tayler ’s ruling outlined a number of training sessions attended by Drysdale , who had 30 years experience trading currencies .
He also backed the bank ’s arguments that the reasons for Drysdale ’s dismissal weren’t “ contrived .
” NEWLINE Drysdale is one of several traders to challenge their former companies in London ’s employment tribunals in recent months .
Traders have met mixed results at the tribunal , with some winning claims of unfair dismissal , but failing to win rulings that they were penalized for blowing the whistle on improper conduct , which would have allowed them to seek recoveries beyond a 78,300-pound ( $ 115,000 ) cap on recoveries .

Ex - Citigroup Inc. trader Perry Stimpson won his case in November after the bank fired him during its probe into currency market manipulation .
Another Citigroup trader , Carly McWilliams , started her trial at the tribunal in London Tuesday .
