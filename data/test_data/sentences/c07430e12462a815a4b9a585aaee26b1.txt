The boy 's father was in court and both men are pleading with gun owners to let this be a cautionary tale of what can happen if you 're not handling firearms safely . NEWLINE
Chad Olm left the Pike County Courthouse in Milford with a lot to say about his role in the death of his 10-year - old nephew Hunter Pedersen . NEWLINE
Prosecutors say Olm was showing a handgun to the boy and his own son when it went off hitting Pedersen in the head .
He would have been in the sixth grade . NEWLINE
" I 'm sorry .
I wish I could take his place , " Olm said .
" I think everyone should pay attention , do n't let kids touch them , do n't let any kid touch it . " NEWLINE
Hunter 's father Robert was in court to watch as the boy 's uncle pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter .
It 's the first time he would see the man who unintentionally took his son 's life . NEWLINE
" It 's my brother - in - law , you know ?
I 've known him since a little boy .
He would have never done anything like this on purpose .
I love him , " Pederson said . NEWLINE
But prosecutors say a momentary lapse in gun safety at the boy 's grandparents ' home near Dingman 's Ferry in May of 2014 proved deadly , while Olm was showing the boys how the gun 's laser sight works .
And now the family will have to cope with not just one loss , but the fact that Chad Olm will likely serve time behind bars . NEWLINE
"
Just a big accident , nothing can take back my son , I ca n't get him back .
It 's hard on the whole family , " Pederson added . NEWLINE
" Handling guns , it 's a gun issue .
Handling guns around children , I wind up talking to you guys , " said Olm 's attorney Michael Weinstein . NEWLINE
Now , Hunter 's father has a message for gun owners out there , in hopes that no one has to experience what his family has . NEWLINE
" Do n't ever pull guns out around kids .
You should n't have your guns around kids , " he said . NEWLINE
Chad Olm pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter , reckless endangerment , and endangering the welfare of a child .
His sentencing is scheduled for April .
