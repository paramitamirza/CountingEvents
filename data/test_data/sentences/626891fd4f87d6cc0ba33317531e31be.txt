The child was struck by a bullet from a .45-caliber handgun Saturday at a Reynolds Drive residence while her 53-year - old father was handling the weapon in a bedroom , Sgt .
Ed Crosby said .
The 11-month - old girl was wounded in the shoulder .
She was expected to recover . NEWLINE
“ I would characterize it as a major miracle , ” Crosby said .
“ It ’s still a traumatic injury but it wouldn’t have taken but a few millimeters to be something far more serious .
” NEWLINE
The shooting , reported about 6:15 p.m. , appeared accidental .
Police did not arrest the father , who was not identified .
Crosby said the father was “ beside himself ” over the shooting and cooperating with the investigation .
Officers were still conducting interviews and finalizing their findings for Sonoma County District Attorney ’s prosecutors , who would make the final determination about whether there was any criminal negligence . NEWLINE
