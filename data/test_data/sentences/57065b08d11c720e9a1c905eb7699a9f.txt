No charges after boy kills himself with unsecured gun
No charges after boy kills himself with unsecured gun NEWLINE Left unsupervised in a home filled with unsecured guns and ammunition , a 10-year - old boy fatally shot himself at his Durham home in February while his 6-year - old relative pleaded with him not to do it . NEWLINE
The chief medical examiner for the state of New Hampshire ruled the death a suicide . NEWLINE
In investigative documents obtained by Seacoast Media Group , the boy ( whose name was redacted throughout the file ) was described as a happy child and a well - liked fifth - grader at Oyster River Middle School .
What is clear , however , is that the boy and his relative ( name also redacted ) were allowed to stay home from school following a snow delay , and when left unsupervised by the boy 's father , the boy was able to access a rifle , load it and fatally shoot himself . NEWLINE
No charges will be filed against the parents , according to a letter from Strafford County Attorney Tom Velardi to Durham Police Chief David Kurz .
In the letter , Velardi concluded the state ’s law regarding negligent storage of firearms did not apply because the gun the boy used to kill himself was not loaded . NEWLINE
According to investigative documents , there was an unsecured loaded shotgun in the home but this was not the weapon the boy used to kill himself . NEWLINE "
This in no way endorses or forgives the manner in which these firearms were handled and stored inside this family 's home , " Velardi 's letter stated .
" But it does observe that this family made choices in regard to how it approached firearms safety , which as a family it has a right to do .
The consequences of those choices , unfortunately , have wrought the premature death of a bright and loved little boy . " NEWLINE
Velardi said he did not confer with the New Hampshire attorney general 's office because the charges fall under the jurisdiction of the county . NEWLINE
All of the information for this story is taken from the case file and correspondence associated with the Durham police and fire departments ' investigation into the incident , which was provided to Seacoast Media Group by the county attorney 's office in response to a Right to Know request .
County Attorney Velardi and Durham Deputy Police Chief Rene Kelley also sat with Seacoast Media Group for a lengthy interview June 8 . NEWLINE
Negligent storage of firearms NEWLINE Title LXII of the New Hampshire Criminal Code , Section 650-C:1 , addresses the negligent storage of firearms . NEWLINE
The law states : “
Any person who stores or leaves on premises under that person 's control a loaded firearm , and who knows or reasonably should know that a child is likely to gain access to the firearm without the permission of the child 's parent or guardian , is guilty of a violation if a child gains access to a firearm and ( a ) the firearm is used in a reckless or threatening manner ; ( b ) the firearm is used during the commission of any misdemeanor or felony ; or ( c ) the firearm is negligently or recklessly discharged .
” NEWLINE
The evidence that the boy loaded his own gun is based solely on the account of the incident from the 6-year - old relative , who spoke with police . NEWLINE
Velardi said his office concluded the boys were well versed in how to operate a firearm , taking into account the fact the 6-year - old relative ended up clearing the breech of the gun after the 10-year - old died by suicide . NEWLINE
" So both boys knew how to use these weapons , " Velardi said . NEWLINE
" They were trusted with these weapons .
So you look at those situations and you go , would it be negligent , under these circumstances , with boys — whether you agree with it or not — a 10- and 6-year - old having access to these weapons ?
That 's a moral judgment that you try not to bring into this .
You have to apply the statute , which is negligence . " NEWLINE
The law also states a parent or guardian of a child who is injured or dies of an accidental shooting shall be prosecuted only when the parent or guardian behaved in a grossly negligent manner . NEWLINE
Velardi explained that negligence , under criminal law , requires a " gross deviation " from the standard of care that a regular citizen would expect in that circumstance . NEWLINE
" Applying that to this family , was this a gross deviation from the standard of care ? " he said .
" A gross deviation has to be a substantial deviation .
Would that then not be saying that even if you do n't agree with these circumstances , do they criminalize that ?
Is that taking the statute too far ?
That , in a nutshell is the analysis that has to happen . " NEWLINE
Velardi said he did not think a judge or jury would agree that what happened to the 10-year - old boy was a result of criminal negligence . NEWLINE
" Criminal negligence is far different than an accident or a mistake under civil negligence , " Velardi said .
" The jury instructions are pretty difficult to overcome , quite frankly , and it 's supposed to be .
The idea is you do n't criminalize every accident or misfortune . " NEWLINE
Velardi said he could have charged the father based on a police investigator 's finding there was also a loaded , unsecured shotgun in the room where the boy was found dead , but said the decision not to charge was a " judgement call . " NEWLINE
" I truly did my best to come up with a good solution for how to deal with this case , " Velardi said .
" I just did n't believe that there would be any gain for anyone to bring a charge .
All the defense would have to do would be to say the child had — whether you agree with it or not — permission to use those weapons , and the judge would have to throw it out . " NEWLINE
Velardi stressed he thought charging the family in the death of their son would be a case of prosecutorial overreach . NEWLINE
" That 's not an image I want for the Durham police or for us , " Velardi said .
" I want us to be seen as applying the law in a rational manner to the facts that come before us .
This was a struggle . " NEWLINE
According to the website of the National Rifle Association , it is the parent ’s responsibility to ensure that guns are stored safely . NEWLINE "
NRA 's longstanding rule of gun storage is to store your guns so that they are inaccessible to any unauthorized users , especially your children and the children that visit your home , " the website states .
" While specific security measures may vary , a parent must , in every case , assess the exposure of the firearm and absolutely ensure that it is inaccessible to a child . " NEWLINE
Is the law , as it is currently written , adequate to protect children in homes where guns are present ? NEWLINE
" I do n't know if you could make a law that would stop something like this from happening , " Velardi said .
" That 's a complicated question .
The more you regulate things , that does n't always make us safer . " NEWLINE
Deputy Chief Kelley said it was well known , even before the incident , that the children in the family had been trained in the use of firearms . NEWLINE
" We do n't have any information to lead us to believe that ( the father ) allowed ( the boys ) to use their weapons , their guns , unsupervised , " Kelley said .
" It 's not that he was letting his son come home after school and take his rifle and go out back and target - shoot on his own .
We have nothing that indicates that that was happening . " NEWLINE Children , guns and suicide NEWLINE
According to a May 22 article in the Washington Post , at least 94 children younger than 18 had picked up a firearm and accidentally shot themselves or someone else so far in 2016 . NEWLINE
Data from Everytown for Gun Safety , a gun - control group funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , which compiles shooting data using news reports , showed that 278 such shootings occurred in 2015 . NEWLINE
During one week in April , the Post article said , at least four children shot themselves with guns they found .
Another child fatally shot his mother that week with a gun found in her car . NEWLINE
What makes the Durham boy 's death unusual , however , is it was ruled a suicide . NEWLINE
" The official cause of death is suicide — meaning , ' homicide of the self , ' literally , " Velardi said .
" You either have homicide , suicide or some manner of accident .
The medical examiner does n't categorize any further than that , typically .
Medically speaking , it 's a medical fact that he caused his own death . " NEWLINE
Experts spoke to Seacoast Media Group on the nature of suicide and how to prevent it . NEWLINE
" Suicide is complex , " said Ken Norton , executive director of the New Hampshire chapter of the National Alliance On Mental Illness .
" While we look for simple answers as to why , the answer is very complicated .
The real reason typically goes with the person to their grave . " NEWLINE
Dr. Dan Reidenberg , executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education ( SAVE ) , said suicide among young children is rare but not unheard of . NEWLINE
" When it does occur , it scares people , " Reidenberg said .
" There 's a significant amount of confusion around young people who die because most do n't die of anything . " NEWLINE
Reidenberg said suicide rates among youth age 10 and younger are low , with 12 reported nationwide in 2014 . NEWLINE
Reidenberg said while most children can not fully comprehend the implications of suicide , the pain they feel is real . NEWLINE
" They do n't think about it the way an adult does , " Reidenberg said .
" They do n't understand the permanence of it or the implications it has on other people .
But they do understand when they 're hurting .
That 's what all suicide is about — people are hurting and in pain and ca n't find a way out of it . " NEWLINE
According to Reidenberg , the best way to prevent youth suicide is open communication between parents and children . NEWLINE
" Parents really do get concerned and worried about this , " he said .
" Most will say they do n't want to put that thought in their children 's head .
They 're worried about copycat suicides and that 's obviously a great concern .
But they should talk about that . " NEWLINE
Norton said a key to preventing suicide is to reduce access to lethal means , such as firearms . NEWLINE
" Having firearms that are safely secured is a best practice relative to suicide prevention , " he said .
" That and reducing other risk factors in the home . " NEWLINE
Reidenberg said if a parent in a household with firearms does n't know if their child is hurting and thinking about suicide , often the parents do n't think to keep their guns locked up . NEWLINE
" They might if they knew , "
Reidenberg said .
" We strongly encourage everyone to keep firearms safe . " NEWLINE
Reidenberg also noted firearms are not the only method children can use to kill oneself . NEWLINE
" Kids will look for a lot of ways to die by suicide and they 'll look online for that if a gun is n't available , " he said .
" It 's important to do things around the home like safeguarding pills , alcohol and poisons , sharp objects , ropes , cords and guns .
" NEWLINE ' Great responsibility ' NEWLINE Velardi said anyone who truly cherishes their gun - ownership rights should take reasonable measures to keep weapons safe from people who do not have the permission or knowledge to use them . NEWLINE
" Gun ownership is a great right but also a great responsibility , " he said .
" That point can not be stressed enough , over and over and over again .
It 's folks who just are n't thinking about what could be the possibility of an untrained person picking this up ( and ) ending up with a tragedy . " NEWLINE
Velardi also stressed no one in law enforcement is condoning the circumstances under which this tragedy happened .
He also implied the family , now without a beloved 10-year - old son , has suffered enough . NEWLINE
" Is charging this father or mother or both with a violation - level offense when this father was cradling his son in his arms , covered in his son 's blood — is that going to rectify anything ? " he said .
" And , more to the point , ( am ) I going to be able to prove that ?
I think there were real proof issues with showing that this young man who picked up his own weapon , loaded it , placed it under his chin and pulled the trigger — all unforeseeable and all with someone knowledgeable and skilled in using firearms — would that be negligence under these circumstances ?
And I arrived at the conclusion that I did not believe that it would be . "
