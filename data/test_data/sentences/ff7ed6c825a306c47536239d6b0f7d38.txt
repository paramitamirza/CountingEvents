KINGMAN , Ariz. -- The family of an Arizona shooting range instructor who was accidentally killed by a 9-year - old girl with an Uzi has sued the business , alleging it should not have allowed a child to use the high - powered weapon . NEWLINE
The wrongful - death lawsuit seeks a jury trial in Mohave County Superior Court to determine damages for Charles Vacca ’s widow and three children as well as his ex - wife and mother . NEWLINE
It claims the Nevada - based owners and operators of the Last Stop shooting range in White Hills , Arizona , were negligent in Vacca ’s death on Aug. 25 , 2014 .
The filing says an Uzi was not a safe or appropriate weapon to entrust to a young girl and caused her to lose control of it . NEWLINE

A woman who answered the phone Wednesday and didn’t disclose her name said the range was under new ownership and she didn’t know anything about the lawsuit . NEWLINE
The shooting led to a debate over youngsters and guns , with many people wondering why parents would let a child handle a submachine gun .
The girl ’s parents have released statements expressing sympathy for Vacca ’s family , but they have not said why they let the child shoot the Uzi . NEWLINE
The range ’s owner previously said the parents had signed waivers saying they understood the rules and were standing nearby .
Prosecutors declined to file charges . NEWLINE
Vacca instructed the girl on how to fire the gun , showed her a shooting stance and helped her fire a few rounds , according to police reports . NEWLINE
He then stepped back and let her hold the Uzi by herself .
She fired the gun , and its recoil wrenched the Uzi upward , killing Vacca with a shot to the head .
The 39-year - old was flown to a Las Vegas hospital , where he died . NEWLINE
An investigation by the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health found no serious violations at the outdoor shooting range .
But the agency recommended it have a safety officer , limit weapon selections for certain shooters and ensure shooters are comfortable with weapons before they are placed on automatic .
