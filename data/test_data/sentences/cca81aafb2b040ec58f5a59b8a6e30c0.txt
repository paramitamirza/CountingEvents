Reward offered as another Philly child , 6 , is caught in a shoot - out
Summer in the city often means warm nights on the front step , neighbors gathered around , children playing in the street . NEWLINE
But any sense of calm on an East Germantown block Thursday night was violently disrupted when at least three shooters sprayed dozens of bullets through the neighborhood , striking houses , cars , and four people - including Mahaj Brown , a 6-year - old boy who was critically wounded , police said . NEWLINE
It was the second time in a week that a 6-year - old child was struck by stray gunfire in Philadelphia .
At least five other children under age 10 have been shot in the city this year , two fatally . NEWLINE
Chief Inspector Carl Holmes said police were working to determine the identities of Thursday 's shooters - one of whom used an AK-47 , he said - and police announced a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction . NEWLINE
In asking the public for tips at a news conference , Holmes decried the shooters ' apparent impulse to open fire and lamented that collateral damage from shoot - outs has become a dangerous norm in some crime - ridden neighborhoods . NEWLINE
" We are very concerned about any type of gunfire on our streets , " he said .
" Once a projectile leaves the barrel of a gun , anybody can become the victim of that weapon . " NEWLINE
The wild shootout erupted shortly after 11:15 p.m. Thursday on the 500 block of East Ashmead Street , police said .
While detectives were still investigating Friday , police said it appeared the violence resulted from a drive - by gun battle between beefing neighborhood groups . NEWLINE
The bullets started flying when someone in a green Chrysler minivan opened fire from the open side door on two 29-year - old men who were trying to retrieve cigarettes from a parked car , police said . NEWLINE
One of the men , who suffered a gunshot to his back , was treated at Einstein Medical Center , police said .
The other tried to run into a nearby house but was shot several times and was listed in critical condition at Einstein . NEWLINE
Nearby , a 32-year - old man , who was driving a car with Mahaj , his godson , told investigators that he heard gunfire and waited for a Mercury Mountaineer from which someone was shooting to pass him , police said . NEWLINE
As the Mountaineer passed , someone opened fire , striking the man and the child , police said . NEWLINE
It was not immediately clear which shooting happened first , or why the shooters fired at any of the victims .
Holmes said detectives were still investigating the motive , adding that Mahaj was an innocent victim . NEWLINE
" This was a wanton act of violence , " he said .
" Obviously a 6-year - old boy is not the intended target .
I can say that with certainty . " NEWLINE
The 32-year - old , shot in an arm , tried to drive to the hospital but flagged down a police officer who was responding to the shooting .
Police took the man to Einstein in critical condition . NEWLINE
Mahaj was critically wounded by gunshots to his chest , a leg , and groin , police said .
He was taken to Einstein and later moved to St. Christopher 's Hospital for Children .
He was expected to survive . NEWLINE
Holmes said at least 30 shots were fired from three guns , including the AK-47 , a 45-caliber semiautomatic handgun , and another handgun . NEWLINE
Several nearby houses and cars also were struck by the barrage of bullets , including a Jeep with two people inside who escaped harm , police said .
Bullet holes could be seen Friday in at least five rowhouses on the block .
Several neighbors described hearing quick bursts of gunfire and took cover in their homes as the chaos continued . NEWLINE
" The only thing that stopped them from killing me was the brick wall , " said a woman sitting on her porch with her dogs .
She , like others on the block , declined to give her name out of fear for her safety . NEWLINE
Mahaj 's grandmother Delores Melendez was distraught in an interview with 6ABC. " People 's children are dying for no reason , " she said .
" My grandbaby is up there suffering , for what ?
He did nothing .
He was going home . " NEWLINE
Police on Friday were continuing to look for both vehicles from which people were shooting .
Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call 215 - 686 - 8477 . NEWLINE
