Out back , behind a row of aging townhouses on Plymouth Avenue N. , there ’s a circular patch of dirt and weeds . NEWLINE
That ’s where the men and boys come day after day to shoot dice , shoot off their mouths , do drugs and deal drugs .
Too often , there are guns involved . NEWLINE
The Minneapolis Police Department calculates that there have been 131 people wounded or killed by gunshots in the city so far this year .
Eighty percent of those — 105 victims — were shot in the Fourth Precinct on the North Side .
The next largest percentage was in the Third Precinct in south Minneapolis , with 9 percent . NEWLINE
Ten - year - old Jon’tayasia Dillon - White , who lives with her mom and four brothers on Plymouth , between James and Knox avenues N. , was one of the North Side victims . NEWLINE
It was 10:20 p.m. on May 5 , a Thursday night .
She and her 11-year - old brother were in bed watching TV when a stray bullet came through the second - floor bedroom wall , pierced her right foot from sole to instep , and disappeared into the back wall of her closet . NEWLINE
Her mom , Tequila Dillon , who works long hours at a restaurant in Eden Prairie , had been home about 20 minutes and was running the water in the bathroom next door , getting ready to take a shower . NEWLINE
“ We want our block back , we want our kids to be able to play , ” says Tequila Dillon , with daughter Jon’tayasia . NEWLINE
She didn’t hear the gunshots .
But she heard her youngest scream . NEWLINE “
She been shot , y’all , she been shot ! ”
Tequila Dillon recalled Tuesday . NEWLINE
Dillon , 31 , sat on the front stoop of her home , describing what it ’s like to live in the violence - plagued area .
Her five kids popped their heads in and out of the front door . NEWLINE
Can I wash your car ? ” the 11-year - old asked . NEWLINE “
No , leave it alone .
Go in the house , ”
Dillon told him . NEWLINE
Jon’tayasia brought her a small plastic container planted with weeds and flowers . NEWLINE
For your birthday , ” the girl said . NEWLINE “
Oh , how pretty , ” Dillon replied . NEWLINE
Their home is just a few yards from where Jamar Clark was killed by police officers during a confrontation last November , prompting weeks of protest in the area . NEWLINE
Dillon and the kids hear gunshots at least three times a week .
Jon’tayasia was one of three people shot that night on the North Side , according to news reports . NEWLINE
“ It ’s a never - ending battle over here , ” she said .
Drugs , drug dealing , gambling , disrespectful men that don’t want to get off my block .
You gotta worry about bullets being fired .
You never know when it ’s going to happen ; it just happens . NEWLINE
They don’t live over here .
Why bring your drama over here ?
Take the drama somewhere else .
We’re tired of it , ” she said . NEWLINE
Dillon worries about keeping her sons — particularly her 14-year - old twins — off the streets . NEWLINE
To be honest , it ’s hard , it ’s a hard battle , ” said Dillon , who speaks with the passion of a community organizer .
They don’t really try to be part of that lifestyle , ’cause they know
mama ain’t
havin’ it .
Just because we live here don’t mean they’re going to be a product of their environment .
” NEWLINE
Dillon wants out , though .
She ’s tired of tackling the problem all on her own , she said . NEWLINE
No matter how much you try to fight it , try to tell them to take it somewhere else , it ’s never going to take just one person to stand up , ” she said .
“ It ’s going to take a whole block to stand up and say we’re tired of this … we want our block back , we want our kids to be able to play . NEWLINE
Jon’tayasia Dillon - White , 10 , in her bedroom .
The tiny round bullet hole can be seen below the window and just above the bed . NEWLINE
I’m tired of doing it myself , ” she said .
“ I get reckless .
I sit out there with a bat .
Get the [ expletive ] off my block .
I’m not playing no more .
” NEWLINE
Although there were numerous people around the night Jon’tayasia was shot , nobody has stepped forward to help police . NEWLINE
This area is really rocked with violence that needs to stop , ” said police spokesman John Elder .
“ We need to get this solved .
Her daughter needs to feel safe . ” NEWLINE

Girl may need surgery NEWLINE
A month after the shooting , Jon’tayasia is up and running around .
But her foot isn’t healing as well as doctors would like , and she may need surgery .
Dillon and her family rarely venture upstairs anymore except to shower .
All six sleep in the first - floor living room , hoping the brick facing on the townhouse might protect them from any more bullets . NEWLINE
And she tells her kids about karma . NEWLINE “
If you do something out on the streets , it ’s going to come back on you , ” she said .
Everything you do , there ’s a cause and there ’s an effect .
My older boys , they’re mad , they’re thinking that whoever did this , they want to get him back .
But like I told them , at the end of the day , you don’t have to do nothing , because the same way somebody did something to her is the same way somebody is going to do something to them . ” NEWLINE
Tuesday was a rare day off for Dillon , and the large extended family was at her house , preparing a barbecue to celebrate her twins’ graduation from middle school . NEWLINE
Dillon said people at her workplace helped her set up a GoFundMe page , hoping to make enough money so she can move her family out of the neighborhood .
