A man suspected in a quadruple slaying of his family Wednesday spent 16 years in prison for killing his previous , then - pregnant wife and unborn child , according to the Michigan Department of Corrections . NEWLINE
Gregory Green , 49 , reportedly called 911 around 1 a.m. Wednesday and told officials he had harmed his family in their home on the 4400 block of Hipp . NEWLINE
Inside , authorities found the bodies of Green ’s 4-year - old and 5-year - old daughters , who were asphyxiated with carbon monoxide .

Their 39-year - old mother — and his current wife — Faith Green was discovered severely injured . NEWLINE
Wednesday ’s 911 call echoes one made by Green in 1991 after he fatally stabbed his then - wife , Tonya Green , who was six months pregnant at the time , also killing their unborn child . NEWLINE
He stabbed his wife and then he called police , ”
Corrections spokesman Chris Gautz said of the 1991 case .

Green pleaded no contest to second - degree murder and was sent to prison in 1992 with a 15 - 25 year sentence , Gautz said .
He was paroled in 2008 . NEWLINE
While in prison , Green completed cognitive programming and had one “ ticket ” for fighting over the use of a television , Gautz said .
In denying Green ’s previous four requests for parole , the board noted he “ demonstrated little emotion or remorse ... ( and had ) a lack of empathy , ” Gautz said . NEWLINE
Tonya Green had two other children , 5 and 8 years old , Gautz said .
It is not clear if they were at home at the time of the 1991 killings or if they were harmed .
There were no charges filed related to those children . NEWLINE
About two years after Gregory Green was released from prison , he married Faith Green on Dec. 18 , 2010 .
Public records show the couple were involved in a divorce , which was filed by Faith Green on Oct. 11 , 2013 , and again on Aug. 11 , 2016 .

Protection order denied NEWLINE
In her 2013 divorce filing , Faith Green cited a “ breakdown of the marital relationship ” as the cause for seeking a divorce . NEWLINE
Before filing for divorce , Green applied on Feb. 22 , 2013 , for — but was denied — a personal protection order against her husband , according to court records .
In the request , Green wrote that her husband was threatening that “ things are going to get ugly ” if she didn’t leave the home . NEWLINE “

In the protection request , Faith Green indicated she did not contact police but had intended to go to the station to file a formal report that day after work . NEWLINE “
I didn’t want to leave my house and not be able to get back in , ” she explained . NEWLINE
The court denied the request without a hearing based on “ insufficient allegations for a PPO at this time .

Mayor Dan Paletko called the homicides “ devastating for the community ” he ’s been affiliated with for more than 40 years .
Paletko said he ’s never seen a tragedy of this nature in his time in the bedroom community . NEWLINE
He called the home “
very well - kept ” and said it had no ordinance violations .
Its occupants had no known conflicts with neighbors , he said . NEWLINE “
It ’s difficult to understand the motivation , ” Paletko said . NEWLINE

The headquarters of Dearborn Heights School District 7 sits at the end of Hipp , on Annapolis .
Three of the four victims attended district schools in recent years , assistant superintendent Dan Scott said . NEWLINE
Scott , 65 , formerly the principal of down - the - road Annapolis High School , fought back tears as he discussed a tragedy he called unprecedented in his more than two decades in the district . NEWLINE
It ’s very difficult to imagine how something like this could happen to children in this district , or children anywhere , ”
Scott said in his office .
This is very sad for all of us .
” NEWLINE
After receiving notification from the police department about what happened , the district reviewed its enrollment records and found that the 19-year - old had attended the high school in 2013 , the 17-year - old had attended it for a trimester last year , and the 6-year - old was in the district last year as well .
