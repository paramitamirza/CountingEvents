In court documents , police reveal a feud between a group with which Jackson associates and a group associated with two of his alleged victims from Northview Heights . NEWLINE
Police write that Jackson 's " conduct could have likely resulted in serious injuries to any of the hundreds of bystanders who fled across Liberty Avenue to escape his gunfire . " NEWLINE
Meanwhile , Judge Jeffrey Manning revoked bond on Monday for Denzel Glover , also 16 , of Northview Heights , who is charged with the shooting of another teen last Tuesday outside the Wood Street T station . NEWLINE
Assistant District Attorney Stephie - Anna Ramaley told Manning that Pittsburgh police intelligence revealed Glover is involved in an ongoing feud between two rival groups , one in Pittsburgh Police Zone 1 and the other in Zone 5 .
She told the court that Glover is a serious danger to the public . NEWLINE
Glover 's defense attorney , Owen Seman , disputed that when he spoke with Pittsburgh 's Action News 4 after the court hearing . NEWLINE
" There are always conflicts between different neighborhood groups .
I do n't know of any connection between those neighborhood groups at this point .
I mean , everything is speculation right now , " said Seman , who suggested Glover himself faces danger whether in or out of jail . NEWLINE
Seman told Manning that Glover is the target of serious threats . NEWLINE
" That 's the problem with gang violence , everyone is in some danger , " Manning observed from the bench . NEWLINE
Seman indicated he will continue to seek Glover 's release from jail . NEWLINE
" Given his age , ( he should be on ) electronic monitoring .
I mean , you put a 16-year - old kid in jail , you never know what 's going to happen ,
" Seman told Pittsburgh 's Action News 4 reporter Bob Mayo . NEWLINE
Asked if he 's concerned for Glover 's safety inside the Allegheny County Jail , Seman answered , " Absolutely , absolutely . " NEWLINE
Manning revoked Glover 's bond and Glover was taken into custody by sheriff deputies in the courtroom .
The judge said if the defense wants to seek Glover 's release to electronic home monitoring , it can submit the request to pretrial services for review .
The defense would then have to file a new motion making the request to the court . NEWLINE
In Jackson 's case , police work in tracking down witnesses and security camera video led to his arrest .
The criminal complaint details how police talked with witnesses , then compared security camera videos documenting where the suspect entered and left on Port Authority transit . NEWLINE
The criminal complaint said a witness confirmed the person in a security camera image was the gunman .
When Pittsburgh 's Public Safety Bureau released those images to the public on Sept. 1 , seeking the identity of a " person of interest , " parties came forward identifying the person in the image as Jackson .
One was with Allegheny County Juvenile Probation .
The other party was anonymous . NEWLINE
The detective who filed the criminal complaint against Jackson is assigned to the Pittsburgh Police Group Violence Intervention Unit , which is investigating the circumstances of the shooting that happened downtown as the city 's Fourth of July celebration was coming to a close . NEWLINE
"
Jackson turned himself in at approximately 3 p.m. today at police headquarters , " said city Public Safety spokeswoman Sonya Toler in an emailed statement .
