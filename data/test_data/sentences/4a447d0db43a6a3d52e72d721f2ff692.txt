" The thought was that it was a 3-year - old child involved , " Randall said .
" He may have picked it up and certainly not realizing he had a loaded weapon , may out of curiosity pulled the trigger . NEWLINE
" It 's a very , very sad situation if in fact the ultimate investigation bears out those early thoughts . " NEWLINE
Moore said he would not comment yet on whether a child fired the weapon " without a more thorough investigation . "
