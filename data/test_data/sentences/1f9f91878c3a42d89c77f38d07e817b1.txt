Arrest Video Charged With Felonies
EMPTY former Michigan police officer shown on dashcam video beating a man during a traffic stop has been charged with two felonies . NEWLINE
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced Monday that William Melendez , who was fired from the Inkster Police Department last week , has been charged with misconduct in office and assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder for his treatment of Floyd Dent .
The first felony charge carries a five - year maximum sentence , and the second has a 10-year maximum . NEWLINE “
We can not turn our heads when the law enforcer becomes the law breaker , ”
Worthy said at a morning press conference . NEWLINE
Dent , 57 , was pulled over in Inkster , a suburb of Detroit , on Jan. 28 .
Dashcam video shows that within seconds of Melendez approaching Dent ’s car , the officer began beating him , hitting him in the head more than a dozen times .
Other officers kicked Dent and used a Taser on him .
He had to be hospitalized for several days because of the injuries he received . NEWLINE
Melendez , 46 , later testified that Dent had said he was going to kill him , appeared to be under the influence of drugs and bit him .
But Dent has said he didn’t fight back . NEWLINE
Dent was initially charged with possession of cocaine and resisting and obstructing police .
The resisting charge was dismissed by a judge last month , and Worthy said Monday that the drug charge would also be dropped “
in the interest of justice .
” NEWLINE
Dent claims that officers planted cocaine in his car , an allegation that Worthy declined to comment on at the press conference . NEWLINE
The traffic stop beating came to the prosecutor ’s attention only last month
, she said , when the video was published by Click on Detroit .
The Inkster Police Department asked for Michigan State Police to begin the independent investigation that would lead to Melendez being charged not when the traffic stop occurred , but on the day that it received media attention , Worthy said . NEWLINE
Melendez was fired from the Inkster Police Department last week , though he still works as a part - time officer for nearby Highland Park , according to the Detroit News . NEWLINE
The man has a history of misconduct allegations .
Melendez is named in a pending lawsuit by Inkster resident Dashawn Acklin , who contends that officers entered a home he was visiting and , though he was compliant , choked and beat him until he lost consciousness .
In 2004 , while then a Detroit police officer , Melendez was acquitted on federal charges of stealing from suspected drug dealers and planting evidence .
He was also involved in two fatal shootings of citizens while on the Detroit force . NEWLINE
Public confidence in the law enforcement is eroded ‎when police officers abuse citizens , ”
Worthy said Monday .
This devalues greatly the work that the majority of police officers in this country perform daily .
” NEWLINE
The video of Dent ’s arrest has sparked local protests and national scrutiny .
He and his lawyer have said they believe race was a factor .
Dent , who has no criminal record , is black , while most of the officers involved are white . NEWLINE
Recent incidents such as Dent ’s beating have led to calls nationwide for cops to wear body cameras ; many police departments , including Detroit ’s , are experimenting with the technology .
Yet one lawyer said that what he found notable about Dent ’s arrest is that officers knew it was being recorded , but that fact seemingly had no impact on their actions . NEWLINE
At the press conference Monday , one reporter asked how Worthy ’s decision to charge Melendez was affected by the existence of a video documenting the beating . NEWLINE
We probably wouldn’t know about it [ without the video ] , ” she said .
