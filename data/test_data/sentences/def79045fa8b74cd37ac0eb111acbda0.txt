Wexler/ Staff photographer Armoni Sexton NEWLINE PATERSON — City police have arrested a second man on murder charges in connection with the drive - by shooting in the 4th Ward last weekend that took the life of a 15-year - old basketball star and left three others wounded , said Capt .
Heriberto Rodriguez . NEWLINE
The suspect , 20-year - old Hasmeek Coles , was charged with murder , three counts of attempted murder and receiving stolen property and is being held on $ 2 million bail , Rodriguez said .
The victim , Armoni Sexton , was a freshman who had been the leading scorer and rebounder for the varsity basketball team at Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology . NEWLINE
Coles , a resident of the Riverside public housing complex , had been arrested in a separate case in the city ’s 1st Ward on gun - possession charges on March 11 , three days after his 20th birthday , according to information previously released by authorities . NEWLINE
Rodriguez said Coles was arrested on the murder charge at police headquarters on Friday .
But the captain declined to disclose why Coles was at headquarters . NEWLINE
Last week , Paterson police arrested 20-year - old Gregory Oliver and charged him with murder and attempted murder in the drive - by shooting . NEWLINE
A news release issued by the Passaic County Prosecutor ’s Office on Saturday night said Oliver allegedly fired several shots toward a group of people near the corner of Rosa Parks Boulevard and Godwin Avenue at 8:37 p.m. on April 18 .
“
Coles is alleged to be an accomplice to Oliver , ” the prosecutor ’s release said . NEWLINE
A business at that corner , 230 Liquors , is the basis for the name of one of Paterson ’s street gangs , known as “ 230 , ” according to law enforcement officials . NEWLINE
Rodriguez declined to say why Coles was charged with having stolen property , while Oliver was not .
Rodriguez said the investigation is ongoing . NEWLINE
The detectives working on the homicide investigation are Sgt .
Ronald VanWolde , Jimmy Maldonado , Ricardo Vazquez , Anthony Petrazzuolo , Audrey Adams and Anthony Aceste of the Passaic County Prosecutor ’s Office . NEWLINE
Mayor Joey Torres has said the drive - by shooting was retaliation for a previous incident and part of a violent feud between groups from the city ’s 1st and 4th wards . NEWLINE
Oliver ’s lawyer , Harley Breite , has said his client was wounded in the forearm in a separate drive - by shooting on Garfield Avenue , near Arch Street , at the same time as the fatal incident on Rosa Parks Boulevard .
Breite said the shots were fired from the back of a white Chrysler 300 cruising through the area . NEWLINE
But Rodriguez and Lt .
Patrick Murray , head of the police department ’s CeaseFire Unit that investigates non - fatal shootings , said they received no reports of anyone being wounded in a drive - by incident on Garfield Avenue that night . NEWLINE
“ I’m not surprised , ” Breite said when told of the police officers’ statements . NEWLINE
Breite last week accused Paterson police of engaging in “ scapegoat justice ” in arresting Oliver , saying he was a convenient target because he lives in the 1st Ward .
Breite said authorities lacked evidence in making the arrest . NEWLINE
When asked about Breite ’s assertions , Rodriguez said , “
The detectives of the Paterson Police Department have a proven track record of acting in pursuit of true justice , not so called ‘
scapegoat justice.’ Mr. Briete ’s impulsive and unprofessional comments are an insult to all of the men and women of the Paterson Police Department .
