The shooting happened on a basketball court during a children 's party near Dexter and Tuxedo just before 9 p.m. , police said . NEWLINE
" It 's a miracle that not one kid is shot , " Assistant Police Chief Steve Dolunt told Fox2 . NEWLINE
" I do n't know what the hell these people were thinking with this many kids out here .

The victims ranged in age from 21 to 46 , he said . NEWLINE

Dolunt said police do not yet know the reason for the shooting . NEWLINE
Anyone with information should call Detroit Police at ( 313 ) 596 - 1616 . NEWLINE
The shooting comes one day after the kickoff of an initiative aimed at stemming violence in the city and providing resources . NEWLINE
The " Occupy the Corner " effort , spearheaded by District 5 City Councilwoman Mary Sheffield , is modeled after a project Sheffield observed last year while in New York . NEWLINE
The occupy program links residents with job training and health care services , utility and housing assistance , and legal help with clearing criminal records in an effort to address the root causes of violence in the city . NEWLINE
It was first deployed late last fall in a handful of neighborhoods within Sheffield 's district . NEWLINE
Earlier in the week , the Detroit City Council rejected a citywide , four - day curfew during this weekend 's River Days festivities and the fireworks display on Monday in downtown along the Detroit River . NEWLINE
On Tuesday , after several hours of emotionally charged statements from citizens and civil rights advocates , the council voted 4 - 3 to reject a plan by Detroit Police Chief James Craig to impose the four - day curfew that would have required anyone 17 or younger visiting downtown from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Friday through Monday to be accompanied by an adult . NEWLINE
The proposal riled civil liberties advocates , raised racial concerns and frustrated some council members who argued it came too late and coincided with the National Baptist Convention at Cobo Center that 's expected to draw thousands . NEWLINE
The council , however , did narrowly favor a curfew for the annual fireworks show on Monday that will run from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. and be limited to the downtown area .
The boundaries include the Detroit River to the south , I-375 to the north , Chene to the east and the Lodge Freeway to the west .
Jones and Sheffield turned it down . NEWLINE
