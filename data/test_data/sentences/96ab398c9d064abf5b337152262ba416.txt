He totally missed everybody and hit her , ” he said .
It was bang , bang , bang , ( and ) everybody ran .
” NEWLINE Brannigan could n't identify the shooter , but Pittsburgh police say video footage culled from various surveillance cameras across the city
indicates it was Kishawn Jackson , 16 , of Garfield .
Police identified Jackson from Brannigan 's description of his clothing and images showing Jackson wearing similar clothing while boarding a bus minutes after the shooting . NEWLINE
It was enough for District Judge Randy C. Martini to hold Jackson for trial on charges of attempted homicide , aggravated assault and related counts .
He is being held in the Allegheny County Jail in lieu of $ 300,000 bond . NEWLINE
Jackson 's attorney , Casey White , said police charged the wrong teen . NEWLINE

“ This is what they call a circumstantial video identification , ” he said . NEWLINE
The shots on July 4 wounded four people , including a woman who was hit in the forehead .
The violence that erupted as thousands of visitors crowded Downtown for one of Pittsburgh 's largest annual events prompted outrage from Mayor Bill Peduto and District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. NEWLINE Police said a feud between rival gangs from the North Side and East End led to the gunfire . NEWLINE
City and county authorities have stepped up patrols Downtown and are working with the Pittsburgh Public School District to find ways to prevent such violence incidents . NEWLINE
White described Jackson as a high school student with good grades , who lives with family members .
White said numerous people have anonymously written him and texted police that Jackson is innocent . NEWLINE
“ We were hopeful our client would walk free today , ”
White said .
Our client was not the shooter .
