3-alarm fire in Portland
Fire Investigators have determined that the 3 alarm fire at Empire Rubber & Supply on Tuesday evening was caused by " improper disposal of charcoal ashes . " NEWLINE
Earlier in the day the company had a BBQ for its employees .
During the clean up one of the employees placed the ashes in a plastic container .
After they closed for the day the ashes melted though the plastic container and ignited nearby combustibles . NEWLINE
Ashes from cigarettes , fireplaces or BBQs should always be placed in a metal container , doused with water and placed outside away from decks or anything else that will burn .
Charcoal in particular can stay hot , and burn for days .
A metal container with a tight fitting metal lid can ensure that the fire and heat stays inside the metal container . NEWLINE
At about 5:20 this evening a fire was reported at Empire Ribber & Supply 80 SE Taylor St.
When the firefighters from Truck 1 arrived they reported " heavy smoke showing â€¦ " NEWLINE
Firefighters attempted to attack the fire but were driven out of the building by reports from Engine 1 , that the roof was collapsing .
Deputy Chief John Harding immediately ordered all crews out of the building and he ordered a roll call of those companies that had been fighting the fire inside the building .
This ensures that all firefighters have exited the building and are safely outside . NEWLINE
Firefighters were able to make a stand in an attached portion of the building that contained the offices and important records storage .
The fire threatened to spread though several large openings in the concrete wall but firefighters were able to beat the fire back so that there was only minimal damage . NEWLINE
There were initial reports of someone in a window of one of the buildings near the fire building but that person escaped .
No injuries to civilians or firefighters were reported . NEWLINE
The busy rail line through SE Portland was shut down for a little over an hour .
It was reopened as soon as water supply hoses could be removed from the tracks .
