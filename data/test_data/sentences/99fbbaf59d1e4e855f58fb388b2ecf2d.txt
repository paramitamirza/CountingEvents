By DAN JOLINGAssociated Press NEWLINE KENAI , Alaska ( AP ) - A nearly yearlong search for a missing Alaska family has come to a grim end with the discovery of four bodies , a dead dog and a handgun just off a trail in a rural area near the family 's home . NEWLINE
Authorities said Monday they could not comment on the circumstances surrounding the deaths but there 's no reason to believe anyone else was involved . NEWLINE
Rebecca Adams , 23 ; her boyfriend , Brandon Jividen , 38 ; and her children , Michelle Hundley , 6 , and Jaracca Hundley , 3 , lived on a quiet street on the outskirts of Kenai , a fishing community of 7,100 about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage . NEWLINE
They were last seen in May. NEWLINE
At the time , relatives said it appeared the family left without packing .
The couple 's two vehicles were parked outside their duplex , and their rent for June had not been paid .
The family 's dog - an English springer spaniel named Sparks - also was gone . NEWLINE
Kenai police Lt .
Dave Ross said Monday the bodies have n't been officially identified by a coroner , but authorities have every indication it 's the missing family . NEWLINE
A gun found with the bodies matched the serial number from a box found in the family 's home , he said .
Officers also discovered other items reported missing from the residence , and a dog was found dead at the scene . NEWLINE
Ross said there 's no reason to believe another person was involved in the deaths , and it appears the four people died where they were found . NEWLINE
He provided few other details , saying the investigation remains open and " is very much in an active stage . " NEWLINE
The bodies were discovered within a half - mile of the family 's home late Saturday after a person driving a vehicle on a trail spotted clothing and human remains and called police . NEWLINE
The bodies were about 15 yards from the trail , which is used mostly by four - wheelers and snowmobiles .
They were in a slight depression in the ground amid grass and bushes , Ross said . NEWLINE
" If you were standing on the trail , you probably would not have seen them with the foliage the way it was , " he said .
On Monday , patchy snow covered the flat , undeveloped area near Wildwood Correction Center . NEWLINE
When the family disappeared , authorities conducted a massive search using airplanes , helicopters and dogs .
It covered a wide area around the family 's home , and divers at one point searched a pond .
Twenty agencies participated . NEWLINE
" I can only speculate how close searchers may have come , " Ross said . NEWLINE
Police said it would take time to positively identify the remains and complete the investigation . NEWLINE
Authorities said Jividen was an active hunter and outdoorsmen , but they released few other details about the family . NEWLINE
The father of her two girls , Jaramiah Hundley , died in a 2012 motorcycle crash . NEWLINE
Adams ' sister , Lanell Adams of Washington state , previous told the Peninsula Clarion that she last spoke to Rebecca Adams on Memorial Day weekend .
Rebecca Adams sounded as if she were in distress but would n't say what was wrong , the sister said . NEWLINE
Relatives later requested that police check on the family .
When they could n't be found , Lanell Adams flew to Kenai . NEWLINE
The four people and their dog were gone .
Besides the vehicles , camping gear and the children 's car seats were still at the home . NEWLINE
On Monday , the families of the deceased issued a statement saying they were saddened by the weekend 's developments but would have no other comment . NEWLINE
