Boy sent Snapchat video admitting to killing friend : prosecutors
A boy charged in the fatal shooting of a teenager in Bridgeport last week admitted to the killing in a Snapchat video sent from the back of a squad car after he was arrested , prosecutors said . NEWLINE
Anthony Mendoza , 17 , is charged with first - degree murder in the killing of his friend Christian Bandemer , 16 , who was shot in the chest at 11:37 a.m. Friday in the 3500 block of South Parnell Avenue . NEWLINE
Police initially said the shooting might be accidental , as Bandemer was with a friend and a cousin who were showing him a shotgun before it went off . NEWLINE
But Assistant State 's Attorney Anna Sedelmaier said in court Sunday that Mendoza should have known there was a strong possibility of killing someone with the gun , that he was the only one in the room with Bandemer when the gun went off and that he told the 20-year - old cousin “ not to snitch ” about the shooting .

In the court hearing Sunday , Judge Peggy Chiampas ordered Mendoza held in lieu of $ 250,000 bail , declining a prosecution request to hold him without bail . NEWLINE
Mendoza wore a blue , juvenile detention center T - shirt while prosecutors detailed how he was loading and unloading the shotgun with his friend .
The cousin later told police that Mendoza was the only one in the room with Bandemer , and Mendoza was the one with the gun . NEWLINE
After Bandemer ’s cousin walked outside to smoke a cigarette , he heard a “ pop .
”
The cousin returned to find Bandemer bleeding and began to apply pressure to the gunshot wound , Sedelmaier said . NEWLINE
Mendoza threw away the shotgun in high grass in front of an abandoned house , Sedelmaier said .
“ After about a minute , the defendant came back from hiding the gun and he has blood on him and asked the cousin what happened , ” she said . NEWLINE
Police arrived and took Mendoza into custody .
When he was put in the back of a police squad car , he posted a video on Snapchat , admitting to killing his friend . NEWLINE
“ I killed Chris and now I 'm going to kill myself , ” the defendant said , according to Sedelmaier . NEWLINE
Defense attorney Mike Johnson characterized the shooting as an “ accident , ” adding that Mendoza had “ no animosity toward ” the victim . NEWLINE
“ What this is , is a tragedy .
An absolute tragedy , ” said Chiampas as she set bond , later saying there was n't enough evidence to make her believe the shooting was intentional . NEWLINE
As a condition of bond , the judge ordered there be no firearms in the household . NEWLINE
Before the he was taken into custody , Mendoza , with slicked back hair and a furrowed brow , looked back into the gallery , where a small group of friends and family stood in the last row . NEWLINE
