SINCE THEN , THE DEPUTIES IDENTIFIED THE BOY AS BENTLEY LEONARD. HE 'S AT HF HEALTH IN JACKSONVILLE. ABOUT 4:30 , THE-- ASHLEY , DO WE KNOW IF DCF IS BEGINNING AN INVESTIGATION HERE ?
IT 'S TOO EARLY TO SAY
FOR SURE. TYPICALLY THIS IS THE KIND OF CASE WHERE THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE. THE SHERIFF 'S OFFICE SAID IT 'S EARLY , NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION. AGAIN , THE SAME QUESTION IS WHO HAD THE GUN. WAS IT THE CHILD OR SOMEONE IN THE HOME ?
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO NEIGHBORS AND THEY SAY IT 'S TYPICALLY A VERY QUIET AREA , THERE 'S LOTS OF KIDS HERE AND
THEY NEVER IMAGINED SOMETHING LIKE THIS
WOULD HAPPEN. WE ALL WORK HARD IN THE COMMUNITY , THAT MANY OF THEM. SHOCK AND CONFUSION IN THE ST. AUGUSTINE NEIGHBORHOOD. FOR HOURS , THE DEPUTIES WERE SEEN WALKING IN ON OUGHT OF THIS HOME WHERE A 4-YEAR - OLD BOY WAS SHOT IN THE STOMACH.
ANY CHILD THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO , WHETHER IT WAS BY THEIR HAND OR WHETHER IT WAS AN ACCIDENT OR NOT.
THAT 'S
EXACTLY WHAT OFFICERS ARE NOW TRYING TO FIND OUT , HOW THIS HAPPENED. THE BOY WAS THROWN TO
THE HOSPITAL AND NEIGHBORS IN THE AREA TOLD NEWS4JAX
THE FAMILY ONLY MOVED IN IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO. I ALSO REACHED OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND
THIS IS TYPICALLY THE KIND OF CASE THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE. THEY SAY IT 'S A GOOD REMINDER TO PARENTS , ALWAYS LOCK
YOUR GUNS
WHEN CHILDREN ARE AROUND.
WHAT PARENTS NEED TO DO IS KEEP THE GUNS LOCKED , NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO KEEP THEM IN LOCKED CONTAINERS AND NUMBER THREE , KEEP THE AMMUNITION IN SEPARATE
LOCKED CONTAINERS.
THAT WOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS
HAPPENING. AND AT DFC TELLS ME , THEY ALSO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW TO HELP
THIS CHILD IN ANY WAY AND ALSO WE'LL
