Fire forces evacuation of Tenn. cinema complex
Saturday night at the movies was abruptly interrupted for about 1,000 movie - goers when a cardboard movie promotional display was set ablaze .   
The incident occurred shortly before 9:00 p.m. at the Carmike Cinemas Northgate 14 near Northgate Mall . NEWLINE
Thad Morton , city manager with Carmike Cinemas , said he was near the front lobby when he heard a hissing sound .   
As he went to investigate , he heard a woman yell that there was a fire in the hallway .   
Mr. Morton immediately activated a pull alarm , which automatically stopped all of the movie projectors and turned the lights on .   
The staff then immediately fanned out throughout the complex and instructed all of the movie patrons to evacuate the building immediately .   
A couple of off - duty Chattanooga police officers and a couple of off - duty firefighters happened to be in attendance at the time and they provided assistance with the evacuation .   
Mr. Morton said the evacuation was accomplished in three to four minutes . NEWLINE
By the that time , Chattanooga firefighters with six fire companies arrived on the scene .   
Captain Rusty Rymer with Squad 2 said the heat from the burning cardboard activated the sprinkler system , which effectively put the fire out .   
The hallway was smoked up for a time , but no injuries were reported .   
Captain Rymer said there was some limited fire damage and water damage from the sprinkler system . NEWLINE
Todd Coffman , the general manager of the complex , said the staff would assess the damage overnight before making a decision on whether or not they would be able to open for business on Sunday .   
Mr. Coffman said everyone who had to evacuate last night can get a full refund if they bring in their ticket stubs . NEWLINE
Lieutenant Henry McElvain with the Fire Investigation Division said the physical evidence does suggest that the fire was intentionally set .   
The investigation is ongoing .
