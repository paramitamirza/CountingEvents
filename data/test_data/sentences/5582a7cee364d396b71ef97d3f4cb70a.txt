Outside a baby blue house situated on a narrow street in Beaumont 's South End on Tuesday afternoon , neighbors were visibly distraught and confused by news that a 3-year - old boy had been shot on the left side of his forehead . NEWLINE
They had more questions than answers as the toddler was rushed to Beaumont 's Baptist Hospital and then flown by helicopter to Houston Memorial Hermann Hospital . NEWLINE
How could this happen ?
they asked one another . NEWLINE
The boy 's loved ones scampered past reporters posted outside the home , declining to answer questions about the shooting . NEWLINE
" Obviously the people here are upset because it 's unclear how this happened .
But a child has been shot , " said Beaumont Police Officer Tony Harding .
" We 're going to look into everything . " NEWLINE
The child 's grandmother owns the home , Harding said . NEWLINE
Police and officials with Child Protective Services were working to sort out exactly what happened to the boy , who was not identified by authorities . NEWLINE
Harding said investigators , as of Tuesday evening , had not ruled out any possibilities . NEWLINE
The boy could have been shot accidentally , or it could have been an intentional act , he said . NEWLINE
Separate 911 calls were made around 1:05 p.m. , the first from Baptist Hospital reporting a child gunshot victim and then another shortly after from an unknown person , Harding said . NEWLINE
A neighbor , who asked not to be identified , said a woman inside the home did n't think there was enough time to wait for emergency responders and drove the boy to the nearest hospital , which is Baptist . NEWLINE
He was then flown to Memorial Hermann in Houston . NEWLINE
The boy , according to the neighbor , was alert when he was rushed from the Pipkin Street property . NEWLINE
Everytown for Gun Safety , an advocacy group that tracks unintentional child shootings , found at least 265 children accidentally shot themselves or someone else in 2015 . NEWLINE
This year , there have been at least 92 unintentional child shootings , according to Everytown data , which relies on media and police reports . NEWLINE
The shootings usually take place in a home or vehicle owned by the victim 's family , with guns most often legally owned , but not properly secured or stored , according to the Everytown . NEWLINE
