2 arrested in deadly West Adams party shooting
Two people have been arrested in connection to a house party shooting in the West Adams area that left three people dead and 12 others wounded , authorities from the Los Angeles Police Department said Sunday .
The suspects were identified as Mowayne McKay , 33 , and Diego Reid , 25 , both of whom are Jamaican nationals , police said .
The shooting happened at about 12:30 a.m. Saturday at what was described as a makeshift restaurant in a home in the 2900 block of Rimpau Boulevard .
According to the owner of the restaurant , there was a birthday party going on when an argument broke out between two groups , which led to the shooting .
Police said three men were found dead inside the home and 12 others -- nine males and six females -- were hospitalized with injuries that ranged from minor to critical .
Among the dead was the man who " initially engaged in the argument with the two suspects , " the LAPD said in a statement .
The names of the deceased were not disclosed , authorities said , as Los Angeles County coroner 's officials were still determining their identities and thus have yet to notify their families .
As of Sunday afternoon , police said , one male victim remained in " extremely critical " condition .
Most of the other survivors had been released from the hospital .
The suspects were arrested early morning Sunday and were each expected to be booked for murder .
Mowayne was being held in lieu of $ 2,000,000 bail , according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department .
Bond information for Reid was not immediately available .
Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Detective David Dilkes or Detective Isidro Soto , of the Los Angeles Police Department 's Criminal Gang/Homicide Division , at ( 323 ) 786 - 5110 .
