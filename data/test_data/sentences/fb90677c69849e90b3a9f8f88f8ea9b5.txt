4 people shot at memorial service in Southwest Fresno
A day of mourning inside Raisin Center Lodge # 5 took a tragic twist Friday when gunfire erupted during a memorial service .
With frightened neighbors watching just feet away."Locked the door , ran towards the very back end of the room and laid on the floor , unless we did n't hear shots , " said a neighbor .
Police do not know how many shooters there were , but witnesses claim they heard more than a dozen rounds before a panicked crowd started running from the building .
One woman who wanted to stay anonymous said she heard yelling."Saying like , ' why here , now ? ' They just could n't believe it , they were all scared , they were running away."By the time officers arrived , the building was empty .
Four victims later showed up at the hospital .
Some were shot in the arm and one victim is fighting for his life."There was evidence of a shooting , a lot of blood , other evidence .
They left , you see a white truck behind me , I know some of the victims came in that white truck , " said Lt .
Joe Gomez , Fresno Police .
The memorial service was for Brandon Porraz-- a motorcyclist who died after crashing into a guardrail at an excessive speed in November .
He had a lengthy criminal history .
Officers do n't know if the shooting was gang - related , but neighbors are calling the violence a low blow."Even
if it was gang - related I think you know , this was not the perfect time .
Especially being the holidays already just around the corner , it 's sad .
I mean they were having a funeral that someone passed away and then now here
we have another four people injured."Police said it is still too early to release suspect information .
