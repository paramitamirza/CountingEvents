It 's the type of venue officers say they are all too familiar with . NEWLINE
There 's no sign on the door or marquee , but just before 6 am Saturday , this late - night and early - morning venue erupted in violence . NEWLINE
Four people were injured in a shooting .
Two men and two women were taken to nearby hospitals .

Two of the injured victims were working as security guards at the club , police tell us . NEWLINE
" The shooting started outside of the club and the shots were fired in the direction of the club , " HPD Homicide Detective Jesus Sosa said .
" From what we 've gathered so far , we have one shooter . " NEWLINE
Police said an altercation began when the two security guards who were shot refused to let a man enter the club .
As they were dealing with that man , someone from the other side of the parking lot started firing a gun toward the club 's entrance , officials said . NEWLINE
The shooter fled the scene , but it 's unknown in which direction .
Police also are not sure if the shooter left the scene on foot or in a vehicle . NEWLINE
It 's the second fatal shooting at a southwest Houston after - hours venue in the last week . NEWLINE
"
Some of them say that they are n't serving alcohol , but we typically find that they do serve alcohol .
And if they are serving alcohol , it leads to disturbances , " Sosa said . NEWLINE
At least one business owner in the same strip center says he 's filed a complaint with HPD about the illegal activities going on here , saying it 's hard for him to run a business with those types of things going on NEWLINE " They need to close it down today , " he said .
" There does n't need to be an after - hour across the street from my job site . " NEWLINE
And customers we spoke to in the strip center Saturday felt the same way . NEWLINE
" It sounds like trouble , " Pam Steadham said .
" Why ca n't you do what you need to do , 2 o'clock comes , go home ? " NEWLINE
HPD Homicide detectives are investigating this case .
They detained one man at the scene , but we 're told he was a witness and is not a suspect . NEWLINE
The shooter remains on the loose , and witnesses at the scene are saying they did n't see anything . NEWLINE
" It 's hard to establish the identity of the suspect if no one is willing to cooperate , " Sosa said . NEWLINE
Anyone with any information on what happened or details that could help police identify the shooter is urged to call HPD or Crime Stoppers . NEWLINE
