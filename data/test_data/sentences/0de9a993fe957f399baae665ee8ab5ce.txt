6:50 PM EDT Posted:Updated : NEWLINE An Augusta teenager is behind bars after a 1-year - old boy was shot and killed Wednesday . NEWLINE
The Richmond County Coroner says the infant , Rasheem Scriven , was shot at least one time . NEWLINE
The 20-month - old died at his family 's home just after 2 pm . NEWLINE
The home is located in the 1200 block of Holden Drive in Augusta .
That 's right off Central Avenue . NEWLINE
A 15-year - old has been charged , although he has not be identified to us because he is juvenile . NEWLINE
" I mean it 's nothing you can put into words .
This is a tragedy for this entire community .
A 1-year - old child has no concept of the dangers of this world , " Sheriff Richard Roundtree told us . NEWLINE
Richmond County investigators are still trying to figure out what lead up to the shooting death of the 20-month - old boy . NEWLINE
The sheriff says he believes two teenagers were playing with a loaded gun when it happened . NEWLINE
" The handgun accidentally discharged while the 1-year - old child was present in the room striking the child in the head and causing his death , " he said . NEWLINE
The sheriff says the child 's mother was home at the time of the shooting . NEWLINE
The suspect , a juvenile who has n't been identified , has been charged with Involuntary Manslaughter , Reckless Conduct , and Possession of a Handgun by a Minor . NEWLINE
Investigators say they found the gun hidden elsewhere and are now looking into how the teen got it . NEWLINE
" We believe it was possibly stolen , but we are trying to back track to see if multiple persons handled the gun , so we are working that angle of the investigation , " Roundtree said . NEWLINE
Not much is known about the 15-year - old , other than the fact that he was a friend of a teen who lived in the home . NEWLINE
" We feel right now that the juvenile may have been in possession for several days .
He may have had the weapon on school property at some point , " Roundtree said . NEWLINE
And as a mother is now grieving over the loss of her baby boy , the sheriff is reminding people of the importance of gun safety . NEWLINE
" So many times we hear people say I emptied the magazine and they think the gun was rendered safe , but we tell people , every gun should be treated as a loaded weapon , " Roundtree said . NEWLINE
Investigators say that the 1-year - old , a 3-year - old , a 17-year - old , and the mother lived in the home . NEWLINE
Also , an investigation is underway at the Board of Education into whether the suspect brought the gun to school .
