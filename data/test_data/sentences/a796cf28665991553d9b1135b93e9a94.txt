" I just do n't understand , why are these people leaving these guns for the children to get to ?
A two year old come on .
What are we thinking ?
And you know they are curious , we have toy guns , so why would you want to leave these guns available for these children to get to , "

Detectives consulted with the Commonwealth and County Attorney 's Offices before they agreed on the wanton endangerment charge . NEWLINE
"
The statute reads that it ’s basically where there is a disregard for human like or you create a circumstance where a human life could be taken , putting someone in danger , in this case the Commonwealth ’s Attorney and County Attorney 's Office felt that it met those elements , " Mitchell said . NEWLINE
" There have been incidents before .
I 'm sure the prevailing question is more than anything , why this one ?
And obviously everything is taken on a case by case basis obviously the county attorney , commonwealth attorney looked at it as well a judge signed off on it as well for it to go through
so it met those elements of this particular charge , " Mitchell said . NEWLINE

Barkley is expected to be arraigned on this charge March 29 .
