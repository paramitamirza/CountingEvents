It is unusual for a murder suspect to be as talkative as Mr. Logan . NEWLINE “
Self - defense , all I can say is self - defense , I had to stand up for myself , ” said Logan .
I asked him what happened at the gas station as officers were leading him to a squad car .

Man I was trying to get some gas , [ racial slur ] asked me
if I wanted some , I tell him no I’m good , [ racial slur ] hopped in my car I told him to get out , [ racial slur ] opened up , I did what I had to do .
”
Mobile Police accidentally led him to the wrong patrol car causing him to spend even more time in front of microphones and he kept talking about what he says happened . NEWLINE
“
All them [ racial slur ] had guns .
Everybody had guns , everybody .
[ Racial slur ] pulled his gun out he didn’t shoot and I shot first , self - defense , ” said Logan .
Seconds later he would contradict himself . “
Just because he showed me his gun doesn’t
mean I have to show him mine as soon as he pulled his gun out what happened , he got shot , he shot at me first , he shot about five times and I let one shot loose .
