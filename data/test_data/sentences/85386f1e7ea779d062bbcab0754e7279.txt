The police department released the following statement about the shooting on Thursday night : NEWLINE "
This accidental shooting incident involving the juvenile is unfortunate , but preventable .
The BPD would like to ask that all of our citizens be in the mindset that firearms are inherently dangerous and must always be stored carefully and handled with care .
Handlers are taught to treat firearms with respect for their destructive capabilities , and strongly discouraged from playing or toying with firearms which is a common cause of accidents .
The rules of gun safety follow from this mindset . " NEWLINE
