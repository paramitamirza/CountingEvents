Care worker allegedly made elderly man feel ' unsafe , neglected and scared '
A care worker with almost 30 years ' experience was sacked when a frail and elderly man she looked after claimed he felt " unsafe , neglected and scared " by her . NEWLINE
The man says the worker , Tuahine Hansen , would order him to make her cups of tea and do housework . NEWLINE
Mrs Hansen claims the complaints were untrue and the man and his housemate were coerced into making her look bad . NEWLINE
She argued she was unjustifiably dismissed and sought compensation for lost wages , hurt and humiliation . NEWLINE
But in a decision released this week , the Employment Relations Authority has upheld Mrs Hansen 's dismissal from her role as a community support worker for Idea Services . NEWLINE
She had worked for the service for nine years and for IHC for 19 years before that . NEWLINE
For the 15 year until her sacking last year , Mrs Hansen provided support to two people in a Whanganui home , owned by the man who made the complaints and referred to by the authority as Mr A. NEWLINE " The allegations made by Mr A , who was described by [ Ideas Services ] as frail and elderly , were that he felt unsafe , neglected and scared at times due to his treatment from Mrs Hansen , " the authority decision says . NEWLINE
" Specific allegations he had made were that Mrs Hansen sat on the couch and called him out of his room to make her cups of tea , that she made him do housework which he found very difficult , and that he was scared to ask her to hang the sheets out .
If he did she had a ' go ' at him . " NEWLINE
When her employer investigated , Mrs Hansen accused another support worker who did shifts at the house of coercing Mr A and the other man who lived there into making her look bad . NEWLINE
She denied other allegations against her although she accepted they would warrant dismissal , if true . NEWLINE
The other worker , Heather McDonnell , said she 'd known for a couple of years something was n't right at the house and Mr A was initially reluctant to talk about his problems with Mrs Hansen . NEWLINE
Mrs Hansen , whose employment file showed evidence of warnings and performance issues , was dismissed . NEWLINE
After a hearing in Wellington earlier this month , authority member Trish McKinnon upheld that decision . NEWLINE
Mrs Hansen 's representative Alaska Dobbs questioned the adequacy of Idea Services ' probe and said there were dangers in relying on statements made by " vulnerable people who were easily influenced " . NEWLINE
But Ms McKinnon was satisfied Idea Services carried out a " comprehensive and fair " investigation . NEWLINE
