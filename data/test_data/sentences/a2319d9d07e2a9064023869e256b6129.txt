Coroner on death of Fort Valley boy : This kid wasnt doing anything
FORT VALLEY -- An 8-year - old Fort Valley boy who stayed up late to watch television was killed when someone shot through an apartment door early Tuesday . NEWLINE
Jaimel Anderson was wearing his pajamas when the bullets flew through the door , striking him once in the left leg and once in the upper torso as he lay on an air mattress in his mothers boyfriends living room just before 1:40 a.m. NEWLINE
No arrests had been announced as of Tuesday evening , though authorities have identified a person of interest , said Chief Lawrence Spurgeon , Fort Valleys public safety director . NEWLINE
We dont think it was random .
We think its a deliberate act, Spurgeon said .
This is a heinous act that will not be
tolerated. NEWLINE DeJad Williams , who rents unit 2-E at Indian Oaks Apartments where the shooting occurred , considers himself like a father to Jaimel and his 6-year - old brother , who was asleep at the time . NEWLINE
I ran in there while bullets were whistling by, Williams said . NEWLINE
He saw Jaimel , who was lying down , looking up at him . NEWLINE
Neighbors saw two people running from the apartment at 1103 East Church St. , he said . NEWLINE
About an hour before , Williams said he received a text message telling him to come outside and fight . NEWLINE
Thinking it was his cousin joking around , he didnt pay it any mind and went to bed , he said . NEWLINE
He said he kept the boys Tuesday night while their mother went to work .
She could not be reached for comment .
A family member said she was sleeping when a Telegraph reporter stopped by a Warner Robins home .
A large group of family and friends were gathered both inside and outside the house , with vehicles lined up along the side of the road . NEWLINE
Peach County Coroner Kerry Rooks said Jaimel was unconscious when the first officers arrived and began giving aid . NEWLINE
He was rushed to Medical Center of Peach County , Navicent Health , where he was pronounced dead at 2:25 a.m. , Rooks said . NEWLINE
Its awful .
He was shot more than once, Rooks said .
This kid wasnt doing anything , but for some reason someone goes to the apartment and starts shooting through the door. NEWLINE
The autopsy confirmed what authorities already knew : the boy died from injuries sustained from the gunshot wounds , and the manner of death was ruled a homicide , Rooks said . NEWLINE
Williams believes the shooting could stem from an incident in which he asked a man who brings trouble into the neighborhood to leave and not come back .
He had not seen the man for awhile . NEWLINE
The family is left with only memories of a vibrant little boy . NEWLINE
He was smart .
He was a good athlete .
He loved to play basketball, Williams said . NEWLINE
Crime scene investigators combed the apartment within the confines of yellow tape that kept the public at bay . NEWLINE
Technicians removed the front door and loaded it into a GBI truck .
Gaping bullet holes could be seen as it was carried away for forensic testing . NEWLINE
I heard some shots, said Jontavious Davis , a 21-year - old college student who lives in the same building .
I didnt see anything. NEWLINE
He said he called 911 and waited for police to arrive . NEWLINE
Stacey Smith , who lives in the same building , also heard the gunshots .
She first thought she was hearing fireworks .
Authorities were on scene when she got outside .
She watched the little boy being carried on a stretcher to an awaiting ambulance . NEWLINE
Spurgeon said authorities do not believe it was a domestic issue , and he had no knowledge of any nefarious activity at that apartment . NEWLINE
Peach County Sheriff Terry Deese said his deputies have been at the scene and will be assisting however they can .
The Peach County Drug Enforcement Unit is also assisting in the investigation . NEWLINE
