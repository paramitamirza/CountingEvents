At this point , it looks like one person has passed .

Collecting physical evidence is the easy part , determining what sparked the violence will take digging . NEWLINE
“ We have no indication what it may be about .
We know the one victim that is deceased is not from this area , ” said Rich Worley , Northeast Commander , Baltimore City Police Dept . NEWLINE
Connecting the four victims to each other , and then to a motive and possible suspects , is still complicated by more questions than answers : NEWLINE “ We’re trying to fit the pieces to the puzzle together at this time .
