  Fire Sprinkler Extinguishes Kitchen Fire
At 14:22 hrs .
on Tuesday afternoon ,    Burlington Fire Department responded to a fire alarm activation at 343 North Winooski Ave .
Firefighters arrived in less than three minutes and found that a single sprinkler head had extinguished a grease fire in the kitchen of Unit 10 , which nearly had tragic results . NEWLINE
One occupant had been preparing a meal and had heated some cooking oil in a sauce pot .
She became distracted with table preparations and returned to the kitchen to discover that the oil had ignited .  
The fire intensified when the occupant    removed the flaming pot from the stove ,    placed it on the rim of the sink ,    and sprayed tap water into the flame pot . NEWLINE
The mix of water and burning oil caused a veritable explosive reaction .
The ensuing fire ball spread the atomized oil onto the wall and cabinets surrounding the sink area .
Within moments the sprinkler head , directly over the occupant ,    activated and completely extinguished the fire .
Simultaneously the fire alarm system , which electronically monitors the sprinkler system , immediately notified the Fire Department and sounded the building 's fire alarm . NEWLINE
The occupant was most fortunate in that she did not suffer any obvious burn injuries .
However , Firefighters did treat her for respiratory difficulties resulting from exposure to the fire and smoke .
She was transported to FAHC by Fire Department ambulance .
The second occupant in the apartment was uninjured .   
Firefighters were able to immediately stop the flow of water to the single activated sprinkler head and cleared the smoke from the apartment . NEWLINE
Clean up crews were at work in less than two hours , removing water from flooring and cleaning light smoke stains from the walls and cabinets in the kitchen .
There was no smoke , heat or fire damage to any other part of the two bedroom apartment .
Nor was there any damage to the other 11 units in the apartment building .
The occupants of Unit 10 should be back in the apartment in less than a week .
The building , part of the Bus Barn Housing Complex , is owned by Champlain Housing Trust .   
Damage is estimated at less than $ 5,000 . NEWLINE
As we come to the end of Fire Protection Week ,    this fire demonstrates the importance of a family actively practicing fire prevention ,    and the significance of having fire sprinklers in the home .
These occupants made several critical errors .
Do not leave the stove unattended when cooking , use a tight fitting lid to cover a burning pot or use a fire extinguisher on a grease fire ( there was a fully operational fire extinguisher in plain sight , within three feet of the sink ) .
NEVER pour water into burning grease or oil .
In this case , if you ca n't easily extinguish the fire using an appropriate extinguisher , leave immediately .
Stay low , go outside and call for help when safely outside .
Unfortunately these occupants did not follow these important steps .
Fortunately , there were fire protection systems ( a working sprinkler system , smoke & fire alarm systems and automatic fire department notification ) built into this apartment .
building .
These systems in combination with early intervention by the Fire Department kept damages to a minimum .
