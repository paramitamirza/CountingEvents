Leftist TV news employee Alix Bryan discovers the Adam Smith Effect
( Before It 's News ) NEWLINE You remember Adam Smith , right ? NEWLINE
No , not that Adam Smith .
This Adam Smith , the CFO who berated a Chick - fil - A drive - through employee because he hated the Chick - fil - A owners ' religious beliefs .
He was quickly fired by his mortified employer and is reportedly still having difficulty finding work . NEWLINE
So let us coin a term .
The Adam Smith Effect is when someone grows up sheltered in such a cocoon of like - minded , leftist hatred of differing viewpoints that he has absolutely no idea that there could be consequences for his obnoxious actions .
All of my friends hate Chick - fil - A , so of course no one could have a problem with me berating a young employee ! NEWLINE
Which brings us to Richmond CBS affiliate employee Alix Bryan .
She not only joined in the internet hatefest against Memories Pizza , whose owners had the misfortune of honestly responding to a reporter 's baiting question about their views on gay marriage , but she went so far as to file a false fraud report on the GoFundMe fund set up to help the family after the closure of their business due to death threats .
Everyone I know is joining in to punish the bigots !
Who could object ? NEWLINE
Well , now Alix is in hot water with her TV news employer , because having employees famous for not just being rabid ideologues and bullies but also dishonest is of course not good for the station 's credibility . NEWLINE
Thanks for another excellent illustration of the Adam Smith Effect , Alix !
