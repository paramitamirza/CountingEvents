In the wake of the shooting , local civic and business leaders have discussed a range of ideas , including creating a six - to - seven block safe zone on Bourbon Street during busy weekends and major events .
Cross streets would be blocked off and patrons would have to walk through a metal detector before entering Bourbon Street . NEWLINE
NOPD Superintendent Michael Harrison told WWL radio , police are considering a model similar to what 's in place on Beale Street in Memphis . NEWLINE
" That 's a good possibility , " Harrison said .
" We 've had those conversations as well and I would say there 's a good possibility we could study that model . " NEWLINE
For now , the NOPD is stepping up efforts to keep criminals out of the Quarter . NEWLINE
Commander Gernon asked State Police to conduct brake tag , seat belt and DWI checks at major points in and out of the Quarter such as Iberville and Dauphine , Conti and Dauphine and St. Louis and Dauphine . NEWLINE "
Once you start taking enforcement actions for those little violations , we start finding wanted people in the car , we start finding guns , dope and stuff like that , " Gernon said .
" People say they do n't see the police , well if they drive through a seatbelt check point three times in a week they 're going to remember seeing dark blue and light blue uniforms . " NEWLINE
New Orleans police are also cracking down on aggressive begging and illegal vending in the French Quarter . NEWLINE
