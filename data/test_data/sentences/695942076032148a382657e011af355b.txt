Former Giorgio Armani Attorney is Suing the Brand , its Founder for Discrimination
Eighty - one year old designer Giorgio Armani is facing a $ 75 million lawsuit , including allegations that he and his company 's executives created a hostile work environment and unlawfully discharged the brand 's head attorney .
The complaint , which was filed this week in New York State Supreme , comes from none other than Fabio Silva , the company ’s former general counsel .
Silva , who worked at the company from October 2014 to July 2015 , names the Italian designer himself ; Armani ’s New York - based retail subsidiary , Presidio International Inc. ; chief operating officer Giorgio Fornari ; and senior vice president of organizational development and human resources Lucinda Rosso , as defendants in the lawsuit .

According to Silva ’s complaint , Armani and the company ’s execs retaliated against him after he reported to HR that a colleague made discriminatory comments to him based on his Mexican heritage in December 2014 .
Silva alleges that instead of taking action to remedy the discrimination he was subjected to , Giorgio Armani execs retaliated against him .
Silva specifically notes that COO Giorgio Fornari denied his request for a salary adjustment ( on the heels of his meeting with HR ) and alleges that it was denied because he complained of discrimination .
In a subsequent meeting with Lucinda Rosso , who heads up HR for the brand , Silva alleges that Rosso told him that if he was unhappy , he should leave the company . NEWLINE
And that ’s not all .
Silva , who spent seven years as Vice President of Legal for Burberry before joining Armani , claims that this past June , he informed the company executives he was preliminarily diagnosed with a malignant tumor , which was confirmed to be colon cancer on July 1st .
While Silva claims that he told Rosso that his doctor expected him to make a full recovery , the company fired him the very next day . NEWLINE
Based on the aforementioned allegations , Silva ’s lawsuit sets forth four claims , including violation of New York City ’s human rights law for creating a hostile work environment ; retaliation ; unlawful discharge based on national origin ; and unlawful discharge based on disability .
Silva is seeking a jury trial , as well as back pay , compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees related costs .
