( c ) 2016 , The Washington Post . NEWLINE
Following an overnight manhunt , authorities in Missouri have detained a convicted felon who is accused of drawing a gun on his wife , pulling the trigger and accidentally killing his 8-month - old son . NEWLINE
Police said Diata Crockett shot the couple 's son Reign during a domestic dispute Tuesday , then fled with their two toddlers still in the car . NEWLINE
The two children were found later but Crockett was still missing . NEWLINE
" He 's armed , he 's considered dangerous , and he 's used violence not only today but in the past as well , " St. Louis Metropolitan Police Chief Sam Dotson said during a news conference Tuesday , according to NBC affiliate KSDK. NEWLINE
But hours later , on Wednesday morning , Crockett " turned himself in to his lawyer and is now in SLMPD custody , " police said in a statement . NEWLINE
" Thanks to everyone who assisted in ensuring the children 's safety and the apprehension of the suspect , " the statement said .
" The investigation is ongoing . " NEWLINE
It was not immediately clear who Crockett 's attorney is . NEWLINE
Police said Crockett drew a gun Tuesday afternoon while trying to persuade his wife , along with three of their six children , to get in the car in the couple 's St. Louis suburb . NEWLINE
Dotson , the police chief , said that at a stop near an exit ramp , the " mother decides this is her chance to get out of the vehicle " with her 8-month - old , Reign , in her arms . NEWLINE
Crockett fired one shot at her while she was exiting the vehicle and struck the infant instead , Dotson said . NEWLINE
The mother , who was " distraught , " flagged down a motorist , who let her and child get into the car and called 911 while rushing them to a hospital , Dotson said . NEWLINE
" You hear them say in the car that ' he 's trying to run us off the road ; he 's trying to cause an accident ; he 's following us , ' " the chief said , recounting what the Good Samaritan told the dispatcher . NEWLINE
The child was pronounced dead at the hospital , police said .
It 's unclear whether Crockett followed them there . NEWLINE
" It 's tragic - any act of violence is tragic - but when an 8-month - old in his mother 's arms is targeted by a family member , or caught up in a family member 's crossfire , I really have to question the humanity of this individual , "
Dotson told reporters , according to KSDK. "
And that 's why I think it 's important that we bring him into custody as quickly as possible . " NEWLINE
Police put out an Amber Alert on Tuesday afternoon for 3-year - old Blaze and 2-year - old Ryker Crockett , who were found unharmed at a relative 's house in Bellefontaine Neighbors , according to reports . NEWLINE
The couple 's three other children were at daycare at the time , according to KSDK.
All of the children have been turned over to a family member , police said . NEWLINE
The search for Crockett , who was believed to be armed , continued into the night . NEWLINE
Police said that the Hyundai Sonata he had been driving was found abandoned , and that Crockett was nowhere to be found . NEWLINE
Eventually , he surrendered . NEWLINE
Dotson said Crockett 's wife told authorities that her husband had made suicidal and homicidal threats in the past . NEWLINE
According to a report from the St. Louis Post - Dispatch : NEWLINE " Crockett pleaded guilty in 2006 of first - degree burglary , third - degree assault and property damage charges from August 2003 in St. Louis , and completed a year of probation . NEWLINE
"
He also pleaded guilty in 2011 to drug - related charges , unlawful use of a weapon , resisting arrest and forgery after St. Louis County police arrested him in September 2010 .
He was sentenced to five years in prison starting in May 2011 . " NEWLINE
During a news conference Tuesday , Dotson spoke about Missouri 's gun laws . NEWLINE
" I think there are questions we always have to ask about violence and the availability of guns and how desensitized some people have become , " he told reporters .
" Whether you 're shooting at the mother or the child in this , neither are appropriate .
The father - who has a gun , who has a criminal history , who 's known to law enforcement - still has a gun and is willing to use it against his own family . NEWLINE
" That , I think , makes a serious statement about him . " NEWLINE
He added : " I continue to see situations in St. Louis where our officers risk their lives to go out and do their job every day to arrest people with guns , and we do n't see outcomes that make our community any safer . " NEWLINE
