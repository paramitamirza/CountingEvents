Walker then went to another bedroom and fatally shot Hale , 31 , and her mother , Viola Warren , before committing suicide in his parked car at JFK Airport . NEWLINE “
He destroyed a whole family , ” said Hale ’s cousin Joseph Simmons .
There are no words to describe how angry the family is .
He is a loser .
He is a coward .

Thank God the bullet passed through the part of her head that it did .
