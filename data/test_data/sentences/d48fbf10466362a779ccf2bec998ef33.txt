On Sunday , September 18 , 2005 at 7:47 PM PDT , nine Companies of Los Angeles Firefighters , three LAFD Rescue Ambulances , two Chief Officer Command Teams as well as various LAFD support and investigative resources , all under the direction of Battalion Commander Michael Rhodes responded to a Greater Alarm Structure Fire at 13604 Bracken Street in Arleta .
The first Company arrived quickly to discover heavy fire showing from the garage attached to a one - story single family home . NEWLINE
According to witnesses , the home â€™s sole resident had been in the garage using a bench grinder when sparks ignited nearby ordinary combustible items .
The adult male was able to escape unharmed , but the flames soon spread in the heavy storage of the garage and extended rapidly through the attic and flammable wood shake roof to threaten a pair of single - family homes adjacent to 1,400 square - foot wood - frame structure . NEWLINE
Firefighters mounted a fierce interior assault on the swift - moving flames , but were hampered to gain access in much of the fifty - five year - old structure due to pack - rat conditions throughout the dwelling .
During fire attack , one Los Angeles Firefighter sustained first - degree burns to his ear .
In fair condition , he was transported to Sherman Oaks Community Hospital .
Despite the stubborn flames that consumed the attic and much of the excessive storage throughout the home , Firefighters spared the northwest portion of the structure from serious damage , and extinguished the flames in just forty minutes . NEWLINE
No other injuries were reported .
Loss from the fire , which took nearly four and one - half hours to overhaul due to the pack - rat conditions , is estimated at $ 350,000 ( $ 250,000 structure & $ 100,000 contents ) .
Displaced by the fire , the resident stated a desire to seek his own accommodations .
The cause of this blaze is listed as accidental , and attributed to carelessness with the electric bench grinder .
