Lovemore Meya Herald Correspondent NEWLINE
There was drama at Chitungwiza Council offices yesterday when fired Chamber Secretary Ms Priscilla Vengesai , stormed council offices demanding to report for duty , arguing that she had not been handed the judgment on her disciplinary case and a dismissal letter . NEWLINE
Ms Vengesai had to be force - marched off the premises by a group of municipal police officers after a standing dispute that later saw council bosses locking her former office to avoid more disturbances . NEWLINE
The scuffle forced council bosses to ask all those who occupied Ms Vengesai ’s office to take their computers and work in other departments .
Those working with public relations officer , Mr Zaphania Mandirahwe , were sent home . NEWLINE
This follows skirmishes that occurred last Wednesday when Ms Vengesai reported for duty arguing that by virtue of law , she was still employed by council . NEWLINE
Ms Vengesai was fired on Monday after she was found guilty on charges of conducting herself inconsistently with the conditions of her contract . NEWLINE
She argued : “ I had to report for work after Town Clerk ( Mr George Makunde ) failed to hand me my judgment or even my dismissal letter .
The problem is I am reading of it in the newspapers on which the Local Board has not yet approved . NEWLINE
“ Why do they have to rush to dismiss me after the arbitrator did not turn up on September 8 to hand me my judgment ?
When she failed to turn up , she referred me to the Human Resource department and I told her that this was a third party , who would not hand me the papers . NEWLINE
“
I had to write the municipality a letter through their lawyer advising them that 14 days have lapsed where they were supposed to give a judgment .
After that , I told them that I was coming to work and finalise my papers while I am working . ” NEWLINE
Ms Vengesai argued that she had a job to protect and if she was not on duty , she would not be allowed to work somewhere else , unless dismissed . NEWLINE
She said after giving council 48 hours to resolve the issue , she had to report for work on Monday and yesterday ( Wednesday ) . NEWLINE
Mr Makunde said in an interview that there was a procedure to be followed when an employee is dismissed . NEWLINE
“
She was fired after a council decision was made .
We wrote to the Local Government Board advising them of our decision to dismiss the Chamber Secretary .
Now we are awaiting a response from the same board , if it is going to approve or disapprove .
Her argument that she was not handed her judgment is a lie because we gave it to her representative Mr Ephraim Katsina .
But if she wants us to give her outside the Urban Council ’s Act , we can , ” said Mr Makunde . NEWLINE
Mr Makunde agreed that Ms Vengesai had to be force marched out of council premises since she was still on suspension .
