Vancouver city manager likely got less than she was entitled to for severance
Okay , throwing this out there for debate in the escalating frenzy .
A senior lawyer with experience in labour law wrote me the following .
You’ll have to take my word for it that this is a senior lawyer and not , say , Mike Magee .
But I swear on my book of UBCM resolutions that it is .
Based on what he has written , looks like Penny Ballem could actually have tried to argue to get $ 700,000 , not $ 550,000 . NEWLINE
There are a couple of points that need to be made ( and aren’t being made ) in the public discussion about Penny Ballem ’s severance . NEWLINE
First , Ballem ’s contract is available on the internet ( just search for Penny Ballem employment contract ) . EMPTY
No guarantee of authenticity , of course , but it sure looks like the real thing . EMPTY
It ’s dated 2009 . EMPTY
It contains clauses providing for dismissal with and without cause . EMPTY
The contract very clearly provides that if she is terminated without cause she is entitled to 12 months’ severance plus 2 months for every completed year thereafter . EMPTY
Doing rough math , it ’s been six years since 2009 , so that makes 12 months on top of the original 12 months . EMPTY
So it looks like her contractual entitlement was to 24 months . EMPTY
Certainly it was at least 20 months . EMPTY
That was the deal she made and the City agreed to when she took the job on . EMPTY
Frankly , it ’s the kind of deal I would tell a client in circumstances similar to Ballem to insist upon , given the risks associated with such a high profile position . EMPTY
So there ’s no surprise here . EMPTY
It looks like the City is actually paying Ballem less than she is entitled to . NEWLINE
Second , at common law , an employee who is dismissed without cause is entitled to “ damages in lieu of notice .
” EMPTY
The amount depends upon things like the responsibilities of the job , the length of service , the age of the employee , and so on . EMPTY
The senior executive of a billion dollar a year plus organization with thousands of employees etc .
etc .
who is fired without cause at age 65 or thereabouts would ordinarily be entitled to at least 24 months’ severance .   
Certainly more than the 20 months she will be paid . NEWLINE
You might want to argue that Ballem was overpaid while she was city manager , but it looks as though her salary was comparable to other big city managers in Canada . EMPTY
The real point here is simply that the arrangements for her severance were made when she was hired , they were the basis upon which she agreed to take the job and the City was able to hire her . EMPTY
So there is no surprise that , having decided to terminate her without good reason , the City is obliged to pay her what they promised six years ago .
