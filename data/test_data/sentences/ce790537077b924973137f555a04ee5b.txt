- Four people are shot in a Detroit neighborhood at Grand River and McGraw plagued by violent crime . NEWLINE
" Mama said nothing good ever happens after midnight
and she was right , " said Assistant Police Chief Steve Dolunt . NEWLINE
When the sun goes down on one of Detroit 's main drags , Grand River and McGraw , the intersection becomes loud and violent . NEWLINE
" It 's obnoxious , you ca n't sleep at night , " said Andre Flowers , who lives nearby . NEWLINE
Neighbors report bottles breaking , crowds yelling and squealing tires .
And on top of that - gunshots . NEWLINE
" We heard thousands of gunshots , " said Lamando Brown who lives nearby .
" I 'm scared because my window is right there and because I got shot three times in 2006 . " NEWLINE
After a night of apparent drag racing Saturday four people are shot - and over what ? NEWLINE "
An argument over a girl , " Dolunt said .
" Some clown does n't know what conflict resolution is .
So he pulled out a gun and started shooting indiscriminately . " NEWLINE
Roughly 50 rounds were fired into a crowd .
Everyone scattered while those four people were sent to the hospital .
One man is still critical Monday , shot seven times . NEWLINE
" That 's crazy , it does n't make sense , " said Flowers . NEWLINE
" Someone gets shot , " Flowers said .
"
Some car accident , someone gets hit by a car , and then they want to show up . " NEWLINE
" It really scares me , " Brown said .
" I do n't know why the police do n't stop it . " NEWLINE
Tire tracks coat the entire intersection .
Detroit police say this area is particularly bad because the businesses are closed and the area is large enough for hundreds and even thousands of people . NEWLINE
" The crowd got bigger and bigger and bigger , " Dolunt said .
" By the time we got to Livernois and Warren , it was in excess of 2,000 people . " NEWLINE
Knowing this problem has been happening for years , police say it is only getting worse . NEWLINE
" It 's almost become an epidemic , however , we have some plans , " Dolunt said . NEWLINE
Those plans to tow cars and to go after spectators and drivers and planning to work with the city .
If they ca n't get speed bumps -- Dolunt says -- how about better lighting , street sweepers and in general , more police . NEWLINE
" So if you want to come down I would suggest you go to MIS or somewhere else to watch a drag race , "
Dolunt said .
" If I have my choice I am taking you and your car go to jail . "
