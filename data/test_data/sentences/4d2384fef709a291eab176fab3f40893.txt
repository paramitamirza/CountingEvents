While police say a gang member is to blame for the shooting of another child in Woodlawn Tuesday , a South Side pastor who organized a gang " truce " in the area said some gang members are helping police find the gunman . NEWLINE
Trying to slow a surge in violence in his neighborhood , Corey Brooks , the " Rooftop Pastor " from New Beginnings Church of Chicago , gathered about 100 rival gang members together to discuss the out of control violence last Tuesday .
The meetup came after 3-year - old Devon Quinn was shot on Father 's Day in the area , leaving him paralyzed for life . NEWLINE
" We had everyone sit across from one another and tried to work everything out , " Brooks said last week of the meeting .
" We mentioned a lot of shootings .
We tried not to pinpoint people .
We talked about all of the shootings . " NEWLINE
Though the area did not see any shootings for nine days following the tragic shooting of Devon , that streak was shattered Tuesday when 4-year - old Kavan Collins was shot .
In the same incident , a bullet tore through a 28-year - old woman 's window , striking her in the head while she was in bed . NEWLINE
The shooter from Tuesday night was not affiliated with any of the gangs involved in the truce , Brooks said .
In fact , he added , the gang members had collaborated to offer up the name of a suspect , who police are now pursuing .
Police said the man is a documented gang member . NEWLINE
" I 'm proud of them , and I 'm encouraged that they 've been talking and communicating , " Brooks said .
" The very fact that you have guys in gangs now coming together and trying to help is a good thing . " NEWLINE
James Williams , who lives in Parkway Gardens , said he was walking away from the complex Tuesday night when he heard shots ring out . NEWLINE
The area had mostly been quiet , he said , since 15-year - old DeKayla Dansberry was stabbed to death there on May 14 . NEWLINE
" And now we got this peace treaty , but it 's scary to think it could all start back up again , " Williams said . NEWLINE
Williams considered it " possible " that the truce could hold up , but said it would " be hard , and it 's gonna take a long time . " NEWLINE
" A lot of stuff has been accumulating for a while , a lot of back - and - forth , " he said .
"
So it 's like you can only do so much ... but
people are gonna be the same way . " NEWLINE
Brooks , though , said he was " very confident " that the neighborhood has reached a turning point . NEWLINE
" This community is frustrated and tired , and we 're starting to come together and do something about it , " he said . NEWLINE
Brooks , who gained national fame when he spent three cold months atop an old motel in 2013 to raise money to buy it , told DNAinfo that he plans to monitor the truce in order for the people who agreed to it to be held accountable . NEWLINE
" We want people to try to trust the process .
If we have peace throughout the summer , than it can be something that is ongoing , " Brooks said .
" We taking it one day at a time .
Even if something does happen , were going make sure it does n't escalate . " NEWLINE
