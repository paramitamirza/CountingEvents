Several children between the ages of 7 and 12 were home alone when the boy was shot on July 9 .
Police said it was a gun that was already in the house . NEWLINE “
This event was a tragic reminder to gun owners about the importance of making sure that firearms are properly secured and not accessible to children , ”
Operations Division Chief Kevin Flynn said . NEWLINE
Flynn said the shooter had allowed the group of juveniles into his home because they wanted a drink of water after playing outside . NEWLINE
This was against the house rules of his parents as he was not allowed to have anyone inside the residence when there was not an adult present , ” Flynn said . NEWLINE
Some of the juveniles left the home while others stayed inside .
Flynn said the gun was retrieved by the shooter from the pocket of a coat that was hanging on a coat rack in the shooter ’s father ’s bedroom . NEWLINE

According to Flynn , the other juveniles witnessed the shooter insert a magazine into the firearm . NEWLINE “
At one point the gun was passed around … all of them touching or handling it at some point .
The shooter regained control of the gun in an effort to put the gun away …
the trigger was accidentally pulled with the round striking the victim , ” Flynn said .
