Firefighters arrived quickly to be confronted with heavy fire from a detached garage to the rear of an apartment building , with flames extending to a pair of residential structures nearby .
Firefighters briskly extended handlines to skillfully extinguish the blaze in less than eleven minutes . NEWLINE
Though Firefighters were able to severely limit damage to homes immediately to the south and east , the garage was largely consumed by flames .
During their exhaustive search of the burnt building , firefighters disassembling the panelized garage door found the remains of an approximately sixty year - old male within the vehicle - free space . NEWLINE
