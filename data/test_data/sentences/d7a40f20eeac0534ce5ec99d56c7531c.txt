The boy 's Nov. 2 murder shocked the city — and the story became even more stunning when police said it was no accident .
Tyshawn was lured from a basketball game at Dawes Park by two men .
They brought him to an alley across the street and shot him in the head . NEWLINE
Police have already charged Corey Morgan , 27 , with murder in the shooting . NEWLINE
DOCUMENTS : Read the court papers describing how Tyshawn was lured to his death NEWLINE
In November , after Morgan was charged , prosecutors laid out the case in court . NEWLINE
Assistant State 's Attorney George Canellis said the shooting stemmed from an ongoing feud between Morgan 's gang , the BBG ( Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples . NEWLINE
The feud came to a boil after an Oct. 13 shooting in which Morgan 's brother , Tracey Morgan was killed and his mother was wounded .
Morgan was so enraged he threatened to shoot " grandmas , mamas , kids and all " in retaliation . NEWLINE
Canellis said Morgan and two other men went out daily with guns looking to retaliate .
On Nov. 2 they were driving around when they spotted Tyshawn at Dawes Park .
and one of the men lured him into the alley where they shot him , Canellis said . NEWLINE
Court documents paint a disturbing picture of the planned attack , explaining that Morgan and his accomplices allegedly saw Tyshawn playing on the swings in a playlot with his basketball beside him .
One of the suspects allegedly started dribbling Tyshawn 's ball , ultimately luring him into the alley where police say he was " executed . " NEWLINE
Tyshawn was hit in his back , forearm and head , and part of his thumb was shot off as if he was raising his hand to block the shots , Canellis said . NEWLINE
" This murder was committed in a cold , calculated and premeditated manner , " Canellis said . NEWLINE
In denying bail for Morgan , an emotional Judge Peggy Chiampas called him " a predator , stalking his prey " — a little boy stuck in a gang war . NEWLINE
" There is nothing this court can do .
You are a danger , not only to everyone else , but to yourself , " Chiampas said . NEWLINE
Morgan 's attorney , Jonathan Brayman , refused to answer questions after court , saying only that Morgan denies any involvement in Tyshawn 's death . NEWLINE
McCarthy said a second person who took part in Tyshawn 's murder is in custody on a gun charge and an arrest warrant has been issued for a third man involved named Kevin Edwards . NEWLINE
" Turn yourself in , " McCarthy said when asked to send a message to Edwards .
" We 're going to catch you .
We 're definitely going to catch you , it 's just a matter of time .
And in the case of a heinous crime like this , it 's probably better if we catch you than someone else . NEWLINE
McCarthy called Tyshawn 's death " a crime that shook our city and quite frankly was an act of barbarism . " NEWLINE
" Tyshawn Lee was failed on many levels but at the end of the day our detectives were unrelenting in the pursuit of justice , " he said . NEWLINE
McCarthy pointed to work by detectives and tips from the community in the solving of the case , saying people were brave enough to step up despite fear of the " monsters " who did this . NEWLINE
" I just ca n't tell you how ... involved these detectives have been in this case .
Their spirit never wavered , " McCarthy said , also praising the community for stepping up .
" This was clearly not a case of no snitching , but there was a lot of fear .
If you have a monster willing to assassinate a 9-year - old child , what else is that person willing to do ? " NEWLINE
Morgan is “ an individual with an extensive violent history who likely should n't have been on the streets , " McCarthy said .
" He ’s a convicted felon and gang member . " NEWLINE
The attorney who represented Morgan on the gun charges said that his client had been held in protective custody .
Morgan then posted 10 percent of his bail in that case — or $ 100,000 — and was released . NEWLINE
After he was released Morgan and his family were fearful for his safety , attorney Jeff Kent said , with Morgan having been labeled " enemy No . 1 to a whole bunch of people " because he was being investigated in the Tyshawn case . NEWLINE
Police have said the boy was killed due to gang ties maintained by the boy 's father , Pierre Stokes , and McCarthy said there was an ongoing gang feud that led to Lee 's death .
Stokes has said he gave up gangbanging for his son and told DNAinfo Chicago he wants justice , not revenge . NEWLINE
Kent last week said Morgan 's family is worried , saying Tyshawn 's family was " directed toward " his client due to the investigations . NEWLINE
" He 's the lightning rod on this for that 9-year - old boy , that 's where it seems to be a lot of the community anger , " Kent said . NEWLINE
