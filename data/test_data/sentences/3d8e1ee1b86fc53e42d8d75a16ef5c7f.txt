Parents of killed teen say they knew it was n't suicide
First it was called a suicide , but new evidence in a Pensacola teen 's death shows otherwise .
Jordan Dumas , 19 , was arrested Wednesday for negligent manslaughter , destroying evidence and a weapons offense .
The victim has been identified by family as 16-year - old Jaibreon Cook . NEWLINE
" He was a happy kid , " LaShannon Cook , the victim 's mom said .
" Everybody liked Jaibreon . " NEWLINE
She told Channel 3 's Allie Norton that she knew from the get - go her son 's death was not a suicide .
On Sunday , Cook , Dumas and another friend , were hanging out at a home in the 800 block of Montclair Road when tragedy struck . NEWLINE
Cook 's friends initially told Escambia County Sheriff 's deputies that he shot himself , because he was upset over a video game . NEWLINE "
He 's a good kid , he not going to shoot himself , " LaShannon Cook said .
" He had a lot going on for himself . " NEWLINE
Three days after his death , the Cooks ' suspicions were confirmed .
An autopsy report ruled that the fatal wound was not self - inflicted . NEWLINE
" So we brought those two witnesses back in , re - interviewed them and found out through statements that in fact , Mr. Dumas was the one who pulled the trigger and led to the death , " Amber Southard , spokesperson for ECSO said . NEWLINE
Dumas ' family told WEAR - TV that the friends were like brothers and the shooting was an accident .
That is why the Florida State Attorney 's Office pursued a negligent manslaughter charge and not murder . NEWLINE
Assistant State Attorney John Molchan said Dumas will also answer to destroying evidence because he allegedly buried the gun . NEWLINE
" This is not a case where malice or ill - will between these individuals , " Molchan said .
" It certainly is a tragedy to all concerned . " NEWLINE
The Cooks believe that Dumas was playing with the gun while their son played video games and that is when the gun went off .
Investigators have not elaborated on exactly what happened yet . NEWLINE
The Cooks accept that it was an accident , but are disappointed it was covered up . NEWLINE
" You see this look in my face right now , this is hurt right now , " Jonathan Cook , the victim 's dad said . NEWLINE
Jaibreon Cook was just a sophomore at Pensacola High School and an upcoming football star .
He was a little and big brother to his two sisters .
He had numerous cousins .
The Cooks said his life was cut too short . NEWLINE
" I cry , I cry , I do cry , " LaShannon Cook said .
" I know he 's in a better place , but I just miss my baby so much .
That 's my baby .
I miss him , so ,
so , much . " NEWLINE
