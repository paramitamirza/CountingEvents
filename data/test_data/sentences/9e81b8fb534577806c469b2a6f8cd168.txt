The Wayne County Prosecutor ’s Office on Friday announced charges against three men from Detroit in the shooting of Makanzee , whose birthday would have been June 13 . NEWLINE

In a second tragic incident involving a child this week , an autopsy has been completed on 2-year - old Aaron Minor , but the cause of death hasn’t been determined , Wayne County Medical Examiner spokesman Lloyd Jackson said . NEWLINE
Police are trying to determine whether Aaron ’s death is a homicide . NEWLINE
His mother , identified by family as Deanna Minor , was hospitalized May 16 , leaving Aaron alone in their west side apartment for nine days before a maintenance man found his body Wednesday , a police source told The Detroit News . NEWLINE
The police source said neighbors dialed 911 to report the boy ’s mother was outside her apartment having difficulty breathing .
An EMS crew arrived and took the woman to a Detroit hospital without going inside her apartment , the source said . NEWLINE

Instead , the family will plan a funeral .
A GoFundMe page has been set up to help with expenses . NEWLINE
It ’s just a shame , ” Oldham said .
“ I don’t understand how a child can be put in a situation like that .
It ’s a total nightmare .
It ’s even worse that she ’s got a birthday coming up in two weeks .
A little girl should be allowed to celebrate her third birthday .

This violence has to stop .
Not just what happened to my family ; it ’s a lot of families .
You see it way too much .
These kids didn’t ask to be put in the middle of these situations . ” NEWLINE
