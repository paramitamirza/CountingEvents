Detroit police vow crackdown after east side shootings
Detroit—
After a 24-hour period in which three incidents of gunfire on or near the city ’s east side in one of the city ’s most violent ZIP codes left a teen dead and six others wounded , Detroit ’s police chief has vowed to step up efforts to crack down on gang activity and stop the bloodshed . NEWLINE
The neighborhood has been under siege by these gang members , and it ’s going to stop , ”
Craig said Thursday . NEWLINE
Gang violence has persisted in the city , despite Craig ’s ongoing crime crackdown — drawing the ire of activists , community residents and investigators who are pushing for stronger measures to combat violence . NEWLINE
There have been several recent efforts to quash gang activity on the east side , home to several organizations that include the 7 Mile Bloods , the Hustle Boyz , and the Hab Squad , which police say is named after Ihab Maslamani , who was convicted in 2009 after kidnapping and killing a man he abducted from an Eastpointe sandwich shop . NEWLINE
His move to crack down on gangs came after east - side shootings of seven people in less than 24 hours Wednesday and Thursday .
On Wednesday night , Aundrea Marie Garland was slain and three others were wounded on the 16600 block of Edmore .
Police in Detroit and Harper Woods are investigating whether there ’s a connection between those shootings and a shooting at nearby Eastland mall on Wednesday afternoon that injured two people , including a member of the 7 Mile Bloods .
Detroit police also are investigating whether a third shooting early Thursday on East State Fair , in which a 38-year - old man was hurt , is related . NEWLINE
Craig , who visited the Edmore crime scene Thursday , called the shooting gang - related and vowed to apprehend those involved . NEWLINE “
We’re going to put forth every ounce of effort to figure out who did this , ” Craig told gathered reporters .
Because we know the streets are talking .
The latest initiative under Operation Restore Order , a series of high - profile raids that started with the Colony Arms Apartments in January , was scheduled Thursday for the 8th Precinct on the city ’s west side , but after the quadruple shooting onEdmore , deployment was switched to the 9th Precinct , where the shootings occurred , and renamed “ Operation Aundrea Garland ” in honor of the woman who died , Craig said . NEWLINE
There ’s been a dispute with gangs in that area , and our effort in the next few days will be to dismantle these gangs , ” Craig said at Thursday ’s meeting of the Board of Police Commissioners . NEWLINE
The violence on Edmore confirmed Margaret Garland ’s worst fears .
Long protective of her only daughter , whom she rarely let her go outside and interact in a neighborhood where gunshots are common , Garland wrestled with the knowledge that Aundrea died in front of her best friend ’s home several blocks away where she had spent the past two nights . NEWLINE
They killed my baby , ” Margaret Garland said as she hugged a neighbor , tears streaming while she clutched framed pictures of her daughter .
These boys that did this , I don’t know who they are , but I hope they go to hell for what they did . ” NEWLINE
It ’s believed that a semi - automatic rifle — possibly an AK-47 — was used in the Eastland and Edmore shootings .
Harper Woods police reportedly found about 30 casings in the parking lot of Eastland after the afternoon shooting . NEWLINE
We can’t confirm there ’s a connection either way , ”
Harper Woods Police Chief Jim Burke said Thursday , but his department is actively working with authorities to determine possible links . NEWLINE
News of the shooting and alleged gang ties
aren’t shocking to the Rev. Malik Shabazz , a community activist who said east side crime is common . NEWLINE
The Edmore shooting is in the 48205 ZIP code , which has been tagged as having more shootings and deaths than any other ZIP code in the city . NEWLINE
There ’s a gang problem in this city , ” Shabazz said .
They have rivalries with other gangs .
They shoot people , they kill people… sometimes they beat and rob people . ” NEWLINE
Their presence has persisted because of a lack of job opportunities and other issues in the city , he said .
“ When people don’t feel they have a future , they don’t have any hope .
They will resort to criminal activity .
” NEWLINE Quelling that will be a challenge .
Detroit ’s gangs generally aren’t as well organized as gangs in Chicago or Los Angeles , which presents a difficulty for police .
Craig , who worked for many years as a police officer in LA , has said Detroit ’s gangs don’t have strong hierarchies , which make it tougher to negotiate truces and cease - fire agreements with leaders .
Detroit ’s gang members don’t follow orders as readily as they do in other cities . NEWLINE
In July , Detroit Police launched “
Operation 7 Mile Cruise , ” a series of raids that targeted two east - side gangs that were involved in six retaliation shootings in a period of two weeks .
And last year , an initiative , funded by a $ 1.5 million federal grant , involving Detroit Police , Wayne County prosecutors , Michigan State Police , Michigan Department of Corrections and U.S. Attorney 's Detroit office , targeted gangs on the city ’s east side . NEWLINE
The Detroit Crime Commission last year estimated there were 2,500 confirmed gang members in Detroit , meaning one out of every 280 residents is connected to a gang . NEWLINE
Erick Barnes , director of intelligence analysis and a criminal justice professor at the University of Detroit Mercy , said it ’s not unusual for economically depressed areas to become “ crime magnets ” that draw gangs .
It runs in cycles , ” he said .
Gang activity is indicative of other social conditions .
...
It rises and falls .
That sort of activity appears to be spreading . NEWLINE
Blood stains visible NEWLINE On Edmore , blood stains were still visible Thursday morning on the grass and walkway of two homes where shots rang out about 11 p.m. Wednesday , and a lone gym shoe remained from one of the male victims .
The shooting was just blocks from Eastland mall , where two people were shot in the parking lot of the center on Vernier in Harper Woods on Wednesday afternoon . NEWLINE
At the Garland home Thursday , neighbors streamed in to rally around and console crying relatives , abhorring the violence that has engulfed their east - side neighborhood . NEWLINE
Garland recalled how her daughter tried calming her fears about the danger that seemed to lurk , particularly with Wednesday ’s mall shooting .
In a cruel twist , Garland said she heard the gunshots “ but we hear gunshots all the time .
” NEWLINE “
I was telling her to stay away from the mall because there was a shooting yesterday , and she said , ‘ Mom , you’re paranoid , it ’s all right , calm down,’ ”
Garland said of their conversation .
I said , ‘ Be home tomorrow.’
She was talking about how she wanted to do her hair , and that was the last time I talked to my daughter .
Her mother said Aundrea was just a few credits shy of graduating and was supposed to go shopping to buy school outfits .
At least 20 minutes after she heard the gunfire , a knock on the door from the mother of Aundrea ’s best friend revealed the worst : her daughter had been shot . NEWLINE
Detroit police said that a late ’90s model red Saturn pulled up and a male exited and “ began firing into the house and struck four of the people , ” said Detroit police Sgt .
Michael Woody . NEWLINE
Two of the people shot remain in critical condition and another remains in serious condition at area hospitals .
All three wounded in the shooting are males . NEWLINE
The red Saturn also was described by witnesses as in the area of a shooting of a 38-year - old man in the 16900 block of East State Fair about 2:30 a.m. Thursday , Woody said .
The car was found abandoned and burned in the 11700 block of Laing about eight hours later , he said .
It was confiscated and processed . NEWLINE
While the investigation of the crime is early , he said , “ we do have reason to believe that it is gang - related .
Plea for information NEWLINE Craig said police know the gangs involved in the Edmore shooting and “ that we’re going to disrupt and dismantle the gangs .
We’re going to do it ethically .
” NEWLINE “ We believe that folks in this neighborhood know more than what they are saying , ” Craig said .
Everyone in the gang is going to feel the touch , ethically , legally , constitutionally , of the Detroit Police Department .
The chief , who spoke with Garland and her other children , said details are still emerging but that he implored residents to talk to investigators .
Anyone with information can anonymously call Detroit police or Crime Stoppers at 1 - 800-Speak - Up . NEWLINE
Their daughter was a good young lady set to graduate from high school when these cowards decided to do what they did , ” he said . NEWLINE
A family member of three of the male victims who lived across the street said the trouble began earlier Wednesday when someone in a green or blue car drove by during the day inquiring who the boys were talking to Aundrea Garland and her best friend . NEWLINE
Cierra Taylor , 24 , said her cousins Johnta Garner , 20 and Andre Buford , 19 , and her brother , David Dunbar , 20 , later walked over to race in the street after the girls invited them .
A few minutes later the shooting happened , she said , as the red Saturn headed west down Edmore . NEWLINE
Taylor said Garner is in the worst shape .
She and her sister rushed them in two cars to the hospital . NEWLINE
Jacqueline , the mother of Aundrea ’s best friend who declined to give her last name , said she had just told her daughter she had 10 more minutes outside before she had to come in for the night .
Then shots were fired . NEWLINE
When I got out here , I saw the young man laying out here ( pointing to her front porch ) , and I saw Aundrea laying over there , ” said Jacqueline , motioning to the neighbor ’s front lawn where Aundrea bled to death .
I guess they were trying to run .
Jacqueline said she got on the ground with Aundrea , talking to her to keep her conscious until the authorities arrived . NEWLINE
She was saying that her leg was burning and call her mom and tell her that she loved her .
And tell my best friend that I love her .
And that ’s all she said . ”
