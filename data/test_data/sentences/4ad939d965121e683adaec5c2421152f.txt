And a deadly shooting . NEWLINE
In a killing with unavoidable echoes of the Tamir Rice case out of Cleveland , a Columbus officer responding to a report of a $ 10 armed robbery shot a 13-year - old boy Wednesday night after the youngster pulled a BB gun from his waistband that looked " practically identical " to the weapon police use , authorities say . NEWLINE
On the morning after Tyre King 's death , Mayor Andrew Ginther appeared to choke up as he called for the community to come together and questioned why an eighth - grader would have a replica of a police firearm . NEWLINE
" There is something wrong in this country , and it is bringing its epidemic to our city streets , " Ginther said Thursday .
" And a 13-year - old is dead in the city of Columbus because of our obsession with guns and violence . " NEWLINE
While the case is still under investigation , police and city authorities rejected comparisons to the 2014 killing of 12-year - old Tamir in Cleveland . NEWLINE
" The only thing similar in nature is the age , race and outcome , " police spokesman Sgt .
Rich Weiner said .
" The facts are not similar , and that must be reiterated . " NEWLINE
Dozens of people attended a Thursday evening vigil near the scene of the shooting .
Some carried signs calling for justice for Tyre .
Among those participating were several members of Tyre 's youth football team .
Their coach described the first - year player as someone with a " smile that could light up the room . " NEWLINE
Officers investigating the robbery report east of downtown Columbus spotted three males who matched the description of the suspects , authorities said .
Two of the males ran away when officers tried to speak with them . NEWLINE
The police chased the pair into an alley and tried to take them into custody .
Tyre pulled out a gun with a laser sight , and an officer fired , hitting the boy repeatedly , police said .
Tyre died at a hospital . NEWLINE
The officer was identified as Bryan Mason , a nine - year veteran of the force .
Police records show that in 2012 he shot and killed a man who was holding another person at gunpoint .
The Columbus Dispatch said investigators cleared him . NEWLINE
Mason has been placed on leave while Tyre 's shooting is investigated , in keeping with department policy .
A call to the head of the police union representing him was not immediately returned . NEWLINE
In a 911 call Wednesday , the robbery victim calmly indicated he did n't want to make a big deal over $ 10 .
He also said he thought the weapon looked like a particular type of Ruger semi - automatic pistol .
Sirens were heard moments later as police searched for the suspects .
Then an unidentified witness told a dispatcher : " He 's shooting him !
Oh , my God ! " NEWLINE
At a news conference , Police Chief Kim Jacobs displayed a photo of a BB gun like the one Tyre had . NEWLINE
" Our officers carry a gun that looks practically identical to this weapon , " she said .
" As you can see , it looks like a firearm that could kill you . " NEWLINE
An attorney for Tyre 's family , Sean Walton , called for an independent investigation .
He also said he was aware of witnesses who did n't agree with the police version of events .
Walton would not discuss any previous dealings Tyre had with police but said the boy had no violent criminal history .
He said the family believes Tyre 's involvement in an armed robbery would be " out of character . " NEWLINE
Tyre played several sports , including football , and was in the young scholars program at school , Walton said .
He had a slight build and , if anything , was on the small side for his age , the attorney said . NEWLINE
Authorities said it was unclear if the shooting was caught on surveillance or cellphone video .
Columbus police do n't use body cameras . NEWLINE
The 19-year - old male who had been with Tyre was questioned and released pending further investigation , police said . NEWLINE
In Tamir 's case , a 911 caller reported someone pointing a gun at people near a recreation center .
A rookie officer shot the boy almost immediately after pulling up in his cruiser .
The officer and his partner were cleared of wrongdoing . NEWLINE
The 911 caller had said the person with the gun was probably a juvenile and the weapon was probably fake , but that information was never passed on to the officers . NEWLINE
A grand jury concluded they reasonably believed it was a real gun and their lives were in danger , prosecutors said . NEWLINE
Prosecutor Tim McGinty said Tamir - who was big for his age - was pulling the pistol from his waistband when he was shot .
He said the boy was trying to either hand it over or show police it was n't real , but the officers had no way of knowing that . NEWLINE
Associated Press reporters Andrew Welsh - Huggins and Mike Householder in Columbus , Dan Sewell in Cincinnati , Mark Gillispie in Cleveland and AP researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report . NEWLINE
This story has been corrected to show that the boy played on a youth football team , not a middle school football team .
The boy 's family also says his first name is Tyre , not Tyree , as reported by police .
The story 's headline has been corrected to show the shooting was in Columbus , not Cleveland . NEWLINE
