Mayor Jim Gray said Monday that Lexington police were working hard to determine what was behind multiple shootings Sunday night during a basketball tournament at Douglass Park . NEWLINE
" I have full confidence in our police department and I especially appreciate the leadership of our police chief , Mark Barnard , " Gray said .
" Police are working vigorously — even today , especially today — on the shootings that occurred last night . " NEWLINE
Five people were shot at Douglass Park about 9:15 p.m. Sunday , Lexington police said .

Three victims were taken by ambulance to University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital , Bastian said .
Two others arrived at hospitals in private vehicles . NEWLINE
One victim was listed in critical condition .
The two people who arrived in private vehicles had minor injuries , Bastian said . NEWLINE
The shootings occurred at the Herb Washington Basketball Complex , home of the annual Dirt Bowl tournament , which is held the third week of July . NEWLINE
Said Shaun Washington , son of Herbert Washington Jr. , Dirt Bowl co - founder , " My dad is rolling over in his grave right now , " he 'd be so upset at the shootings . NEWLINE
During its peak , the Dirt Bowl was the top outdoor basketball league in the country , according to the city of Lexington 's website .
It was even featured in Sports Illustrated and USA Today . NEWLINE
No arrests have been made in the shootings , and there " was a lot of conflicting information " about what happened , Bastian said . NEWLINE
The area has seen other violence of late .
On June 7 , just a little more than a half - mile from Douglass Park , three men who were related to one another were shot in two separate incidents just hours and blocks apart . NEWLINE
Montez Graves , 31 , and Ronnie Graves , 54 , were killed .
Police charged Jermaine Anderson , 21 , with murder in Montez Graves ' killing . NEWLINE
" Because these cases are under investigation , I ca n't go into the specifics of the cases , but in many of these cases , drugs are a common denominator , " the mayor said . NEWLINE
Gray said police were contacting area churches and the NAACP to help address the recent uptick in violent crime .
The city saw a similar increase in shootings early last summer . NEWLINE
" We see the rate of incidents grow in the summer , " Gray said of violent crimes .
" This is regrettable but factual . " NEWLINE
Police are asking for help from residents in their investigation of the Douglass Park shootings . NEWLINE
" When the shots were fired , there was a lot of chaos , " Bastian said .
" We 're having difficulty identifying witnesses .
So we would make a big plea for people , if they were here and if they saw anything , they do n't have to meet us in person .
They can call ( 859 ) 258 - 3700 . " NEWLINE
