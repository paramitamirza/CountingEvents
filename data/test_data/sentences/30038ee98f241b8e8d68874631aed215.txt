NEWLINE
First units on the scene reported a large two story produce building with a 150-by-150 portion of the structure well involved with fire on the first and second floors .
Due to the wind factor , one helicopter was requested to patrol down wind for hot embers and brands that could ignite other structures .
Firefighters entered the first floor with handlines to aggressively attack the fire that was spreading rapidly to the second floor and attic area .
During the interior fire attack firefighters encountered rapid fire spread and a large volume of heat and fire that forced them to withdraw from an interior attack and take up a defensive position on the exterior of the building with handlines and heavy stream appliances . NEWLINE
After approximately two - hours and one minute , over 170 firefighters confined and extinguished the fire in several produce businesses on the first floor of the " 7th Street Market " and vacant offices on the second floor .
Division walls separating portions of the large structure prevented significant vertical and horizontal fire spread to other uninvolved portions of the building .
Shortly after firefighters had been ordered off a sagging portion of the roof , it collapsed .
Firefighter safety , preservation of produce in other parts of the building , the integrity of the structure 's roof , floor and walls , the large volume of fire causing rapid fire spread , and downwind observation , were just some of the special concerns of the incident commander directing fire ground operations at this major emergency structure fire .
No injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is listed as under investigation .
Fire damage is estimated at $ 1,000,000 ( $ 800,000 structure and $ 200,000 contents ) . EMPTY
