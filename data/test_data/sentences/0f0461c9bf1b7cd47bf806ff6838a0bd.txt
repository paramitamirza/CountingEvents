Police took into custody two “ persons of interest ” — a man and a woman , who was among those injured — but neither has been formally arrested . NEWLINE

“ The people shot either do n't know the killers or are n't telling us what they do know . " NEWLINE
As for the motive , Whittingham said it may have been more than a simple argument that erupted at the eatery , but detectives could not say for sure .
A gun was recovered from the scene . NEWLINE
" It may be a narcotics - related dispute … a dispute between parties over business transactions , " Whittingham said . NEWLINE
Detectives believe the shooters killed their primary target with a hail of bullets . NEWLINE
