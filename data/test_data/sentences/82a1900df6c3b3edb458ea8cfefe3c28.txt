Neighbors say activity at the home does n't appear to them like an average family routine . NEWLINE
The unidentified 3-year - old was shot with a small - caliber gun just before 8:30 Wednesday night .
The police response frightened one neighbor . NEWLINE
" It 's a little nerve - wracking .
We locked everything up tight last night just because we do n't know what 's going on , " said Tanya Gray . NEWLINE
Neighbors do n't know the family very well .
They say this is a sad situation and this is n't the first time police have been called to the home .
One neighbor questioned the safety of children there . NEWLINE
" There 's been activities going on for the last few years and there 's been activities that probably are n't conducive with having children in the home .
There 's been police at that home many times since we 've been here over the past several years , " said Chris Cheff . NEWLINE
Cheff has seen children running on the roof of a trailer that sits on the property .
" Kids doing things that are n't probably very safe , " said Cheff . NEWLINE
Gray only saw the 3-year - old gunshot victim outside once . NEWLINE
" The only time I ever saw him was during the daytime , about in the afternoon and he was in a diaper -- no shirt , no shoes , just kind of hanging out on the stairs by the front door , and then later I 'd see him by the vehicle that 's there sometimes , " said Gray . NEWLINE
But what she 's seen outside of the house , does n't seem to have a consistent schedule . NEWLINE
" There are different kids that come and go in there .
Because I 'm a stay - at - home mom , I 've been retired for three years , I see kids out at all different ages at all different times of the day , " said Gray . NEWLINE
Gray says adults are usually inside , rarely out with the kids .
She says the father is an artist . NEWLINE
" The gentleman that owns it is a very talented artist .
He does metal sculpture work and they 're absolutely gorgeous , " said Gray . NEWLINE
Gray also says the father seemed to be the only one who stayed in the house full - time . NEWLINE
Police are still investigating . NEWLINE
Lake County is still treating this as an accident and no charges have been filed at this time .
