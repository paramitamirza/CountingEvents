The only person arrested after a gunfight left a bystander dead and nine people hurt on New Orleans ' famous Bourbon Street last year could learn next week whether he can get a complete list of witnesses in the case . NEWLINE
Trung Le was captured days after the June 29 gunfight .
He was charged with manslaughter and attempted second - degree murder .
But his attorney , Martin Regan , says Le fired in self - defense to save himself and others from another , still unidentified gunman . NEWLINE
Regan has been seeking police documents that include identities of all witnesses in the case .
