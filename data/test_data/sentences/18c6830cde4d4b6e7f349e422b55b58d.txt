Sprinklers Snuff Arson Fire at LA Temple
On Friday , July 7 , 2006 at 8:04 a.m. , two companies of Los Angeles firefighters and four LAFD arson investigators responded to an Incendiary Fire at ' Temple Beith David ' located at 18648 Clark Street in Tarzana . NEWLINE
Summoned but once by a neighbor who had grown weary of hearing alarm bells ringing at the building for more than two hours , neighborhood firefighters arrived quickly to discover burnt debris piled against rear doors of the Jewish Temple amidst obvious signs of criminal vandalism . NEWLINE
In accordance with Los Angeles Fire Department protocol , the House of Worship Arson Task Force ( HOWATF ) was requested as firefighters cordoned off the area and confirmed that fire sprinklers located under the eaves of the recently refurbished building had indeed fully extinguished the flames . NEWLINE
Investigators from the Los Angeles Fire Department and Los Angeles Police Department were soon joined at the scene by their HOWATF colleagues from the United States Department of Justice : Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives in commencing a formal investigation . NEWLINE
Property loss attributed to the purposely - set blaze , including damage to a pair of large oak doors , is estimated at $ 9,000 .
No physical injuries were reported . NEWLINE
The sprinkler - activated bells heard by the neighbor appear to have only sounded locally , and were not connected to an alarm service that would have notified firefighters at the time of sprinkler activation . NEWLINE
While no credible threat is now known to local houses of worship , firefighters ask residents to remain watchful of such properties , and to report suspicious activity to Law Enforcement officials . NEWLINE
Firefighters also suggest that those with commercial alarm and/or sprinkler systems assure they are both functional and connected to a monitoring service . NEWLINE
This arson fire is not expected to effect a planned Sunday dedication ceremony at the site , celebrating the building 's four - year conversion from a post office to the San Fernando Valley 's newest synagogue . NEWLINE
The criminal attack remains under active investigation by members of the multi - agency House of Worship Arson Task Force .
Those with information or tips for the investigation team are asked to contact LAFD Investigator Thomas Derby at 213 - 485 - 6514 or FBI Agent Kenneth E. Smith at 310 - 477 - 6565 .
