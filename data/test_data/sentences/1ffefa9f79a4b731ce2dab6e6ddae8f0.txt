At 12:40 p.m. , Tyra Ruffin was sitting on her grandmother 's porch in the 4100 block of West Potomac Avenue with her father and his friend when two men emerged from a gangway and started shooting , police and witnesses said . NEWLINE
Tyra was taken to Norwegian American Hospital after sustaining a graze wound and was in fair condition , according to Officer Bari Lemmon , a Chicago Police spokeswoman . NEWLINE

Tyra had been sitting in her father 's lap when the shots rang out , she said . NEWLINE
" I heard the gunshots , and then I heard my dad say ' Get on the ground , ' " she said .
As she ran inside the house , she realized she was bleeding from her arm . NEWLINE
" When I saw her she was all ' Ahhh , " said Tyra 's grandmother , Yvette Ruffin .
" Then I was like , ' Ohhhh , that 's a bullet . '
It skimmed her . " NEWLINE
Hours after the shooting , Yvette stood in front of her brownstone two - flat with her arm wrapped tightly around Tyra 's shoulders , as more of her grandchildren scurried and played around her . NEWLINE
" That 's a nip , " Yvette told her granddaughter , giving her a gentle squeeze .
" You ai n't get shot , you just got nipped . " NEWLINE
But Yvette did n't want to take any chances , she said .
She wanted to leave the city , and take her family with her . NEWLINE
" We hear shots all the time , " Yvette said .
" We got to make them go in the house .
It 's dangerous . " NEWLINE
Tyra said she wanted to move away , too . NEWLINE
" I do n't like it here , " she said quietly , eyes fixed at the ground . NEWLINE
Nanette Rios was in her basement apartment below the porch when she heard the shots ring out , she said .
Her 11-year - old son , Devin Henderson , was playing video games when she grabbed him by his shirt and pushed him into a closet to wait for the gunfire to end . NEWLINE
" I almost got shot , " Devin said Thursday afternoon , scowling .
He stood barefoot in front of his home , clutching a kids ' version of the Bible .
His finger bookmarked a page titled " Passages to read when you 're scared . " NEWLINE
Devin said he hears gunshots on the block constantly . NEWLINE
" I just feel like everything is wrong in the world , " he said .
" I feel like everything is going to pieces . " NEWLINE
Rios stood next to her son , beaming down at him . NEWLINE
" This got to stop , for real , " she said .
" We got kids out here , you know .
We 're all families here .
That 's so wrong for them to shoot like this . " NEWLINE
Police said both of the men shot were documented gang members . NEWLINE
" It might have been gang - related , I do n't know , " Yvette Ruffin said of the shooting . NEWLINE
