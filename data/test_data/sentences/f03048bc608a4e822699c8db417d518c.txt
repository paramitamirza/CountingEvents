Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue battles barn fire
Wednesday   night at 12:58 am , Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue was called to a reported barn fire at 22170 S.W. Stafford Road .
When crews arrived they found a fully engulfed , 40 x 60 ft .
metal pole barn .
The owner 's adult son was on scene and told firefighters that the building had no animals inside and was used for storing equipment , vehicles , and hay – all of which likely contributed to fueling the fire . NEWLINE
The building contained a motor home and a 1959 restored MG sports car .
Although the pole barn and vehicles inside were beyond saving when crews arrived , firefighters waged an aggressive fire attack and protected several exposures threatened by the fiery building including a camping trailer , several personal vehicles , and a large fuel storage tank .
For almost an hour firefighters battled hostile fire and protected exposures due to the collapsed metal roof and walls that were an impediment to firefighting water .
Due to the property being located in an area not served by fire hydrants , water tenders were utilized to provide a continuous water shuttle throughout the firefighting operation .
Firefighters remained on scene overnight battling hot spots and ensuring the fire did not spread outside the pole barn . NEWLINE
The fire remains under investigation at this hour .
TVF&R 's fire investigator plans to go back out to the scene later today .
