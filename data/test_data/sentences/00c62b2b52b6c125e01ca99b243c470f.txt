Indianapolis Metropolitan Police detectives are investigating the deaths of four people who were found shot multiple times in a home that was broken into and ransacked . NEWLINE
The owner of a home called police around 9:45 a.m. Tuesday after she discovered the four victims , three woman and one man , officer Chris Wilburn said . NEWLINE
Televisions were toppled over in the home , which Wilburn said was " ransacked . "
He said there were signs the suspect or suspects forced their way into the residence . NEWLINE
Police did not immediately say who the victims are or how they are connected to the female homeowner . NEWLINE
A crowd of people gathered in the neighborhood throughout the morning and afternoon waiting for information about the victims .
Some cried and appeared anguished .
One woman vomited on the street . NEWLINE
"
Please bear with us , " Police Chief Rick Hite told the anxious group at one point . NEWLINE
Hite said investigators were treating the case as they would if the victims were their own family members , and slowly and carefully combing the home for clues . NEWLINE
Comforting his family members on the street , Charles Richardson said his sister was the person who discovered the victims .
He said he was called to his sister 's house Tuesday morning , unsure of what he would find . NEWLINE
Police allowed him to cross the crime scene tape to be with his sister , who he said was distraught . NEWLINE
" I comforted her , " Richardson said , standing outside on his sister 's street . NEWLINE
But she could n't elaborate on what she saw , he said .
Like the rest of the group , Richardson said he was waiting to learn who the victims are . NEWLINE
" We are praying , " he said . NEWLINE
Police initially described the shootings as " execution style , " but Hite later said that description was not accurate . NEWLINE
Investigators said each victim was shot multiple times , but would not say where they were hit . NEWLINE
" There were a significant amount of shots , " Wilburn said . NEWLINE

Hite did not say whether police had any suspects , but he said investigators believe the incident was not a random act of violence . NEWLINE
The neighborhood is near one of six focus areas highlighted by the police department last year for extra attention because of their disproportionate amount of violent crime . NEWLINE
Michael Coleman , a resident of the neighborhood , said North Harding Street appeared normal Tuesday morning until police rushed to the area . NEWLINE
He said he was rattled by the police activity . NEWLINE
" I 'm trying to get out of here in the next month , " said Coleman . NEWLINE
Other neighbors echoed his sentiment . NEWLINE
Stanley Brown , a 59-year - old lifelong Indianapolis resident , said he recently invested in vacant lots in a nearby neighborhood , hoping it would pay off if the neighborhood becomes targeted for redevelopment . NEWLINE
But he is now wondering if that investment was a mistake . NEWLINE
" I do n't know if I should try to hold onto it or sell it , " Brown said . NEWLINE
On Saturday less than a half mile away , a man shot and killed his brother because he believed he was shooting an intruder . NEWLINE
