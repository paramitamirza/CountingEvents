The shooting death of a 17-year - old boy in the Bronx Thursday is being investigated as accidental , and the man believed to have fired the deadly shot was arrested on Friday .
Police say Ackeem Davis was shot to death while in his apartment on Astor Avenue in the Allerton section around 5 p.m. , and that friends were " play fighting " and wrestling while a gun was nearby .
The weapon accidentally went off , police said , believing that some of those in the room did not know that gun was loaded .
Steafon Lewis , 19 , was taken into custody and charged with manslaughter and criminal possession of a firearm .
Three men and a woman who were in the room at the time of the shooting room were being interviewed , and police are looking for additional people who were in the apartment at the time and left after the shooting .
The weapon has still not been recovered .
Sources told Eyewitness News that there were videos posted online using Facebook Live before the shooting , showing the victim and other people in the room .
It appears to have been taken at least a half hour before the shooting and shows the teens hanging out , smoking and listening to music in an apartment .
Police believe one of the visitors brought the gun .
Friends and family gathered in front of a series of candles put in front of the building , leaving messages as part of a growing memorial .
Davis ' friends say he was a nice guy with big plans , and the last person anyone would want to hurt .
He would 've turned 18 next week and was set to graduate high school next month before joining the Army .
He was known among friends and neighbors for being humble and having a contagious sense of humor."Very polite boy , " neighbor Nancy Gonzales said .
" Very sweet kid .
He would say good morning , good afternoon , good evening .
He would hold the door for you .
If he saw you with a package , he would assist you with it."The investigation is ongoing , as detectives try to figure out exactly how he ended up with a gunshot wound to the chest .
He stumbled into the hallway and collapsed , and he was pronounced dead at Jacobi Hospital."He was nice , well - known kid , " family friend Rachel Williams said .
" Very good , not a trouble - maker .
He did n't deserve that."Neighbors say his mother is a postal worker who made sure her son stayed out of trouble."His mother is a very hard worker , " Gonzalez said .
" I even cried a couple of tears , because he 's my neighbor . "
