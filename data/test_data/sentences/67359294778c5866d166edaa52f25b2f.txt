After Employee Denies Service to Uniformed Police Officer
The police report said that a manager told Martin that employee Kenny Davenport didn’t want to serve her because she ’s a police officer .
The manager also reportedly laughed and said that Davenport was allowed to refuse service .
Martin said she was worried about the condition of her food and got a refund .
Davenport claims that this was all a joke , but the PBA wants the employees involved to be fired .
“ It is beyond comprehension and deeply troubling that a business would deny service to a law enforcement officer just for being a law enforcement officer [ … ]
This is yet another example of the hostile treatment of our brave men and women simply because they wear a badge .
It is unacceptable and warrants much more than an apology .
We support our brothers and sisters who wear the badge in Broward County and across the United States .
Until corrective action is taken and the employees involved in this incident are terminated , we are calling for a national boycott of Arby ’s , ”
Florida and Dade County PBA president John Rivera said in a statement .
What do you think of the proposed boycott ?
