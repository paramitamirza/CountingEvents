" We do n't know the reason for his actions .
We would hope that somewhere in the course of the investigation we learn more about him or what motivated him , " D'Amico said . NEWLINE

For 20 years , Myers was a machine operator at Waterbury Felt , which makes industrial textiles , the Associated Press reported . NEWLINE
Steve Copperwheat , who hired Myers in the early 1980s , described him as a good worker who was quiet , intelligent and got along well with other employees . NEWLINE
Cooperwheat encountered Myers three months ago in a Walmart parking lot after having not seen him in a decade .
He called their brief conversation " really spooky . " NEWLINE
" I yelled over to him and he looked at me , said my name , said he was retired , and just went booking away , "
Copperwheat said .
" It was almost like he did n't want anybody to know where he was .
He was trying to be very distant , which surprised me . " NEWLINE
Myers ' rampage started with a fire in his apartment in the nearby village of Mohawk on Wednesday morning .
Police said he then shot two people dead and wounded two others at a barbershop around the corner before killing two more at a Herkimer oil - change and carwash business . NEWLINE
The shootings shattered the peace and rattled the nerves of Mohawk and Herkimer , two small villages about 170 miles northwest of New York City , separated from each other by the Mohawk River and the New York State Thruway . NEWLINE
After searching the area for several hours , officers encountered a flurry of gunfire coming from the abandoned building . NEWLINE

Hi , John , do you remember me ? ' and my brother said , ' Yes , Kurt , how are you ? '
and then he just started shooting , " Mary Hornett said . NEWLINE
" My brother could n't think of any reason why he would do such a thing , " she said of Myers , a former customer who had n't come in for a haircut in a couple of years . NEWLINE

( March 13 ) AP NEWLINE Police said Myers began the day about 9:30 a.m. by setting fire to his apartment in the rear of a three - unit building directly across the street from the police and fire departments .
Firefighters extinguished the blaze in about 90 minutes . NEWLINE
Investigators found several weapons and ammunition inside , but police have not said whether they belonged to Myers . NEWLINE
Neighbors said they barely knew Myers , who rarely spoke , left every morning in his red Jeep and came back . NEWLINE
Traci Randall said the only time she remembers speaking to her next - door neighbor was when he yelled at her son because he thought he had shot an air pellet at his Jeep . NEWLINE
" He would walk by himself .
He was kind of a loner .
No wife , " she said . NEWLINE
Neighbors said he never had visitors or friends .
Gary Urich said Myers would n't even say as much as ' Hi ' to him when walking by his porch . NEWLINE
" I said , ' How are you doing ? '
No response .
He just walked by , " he said . NEWLINE
Michele Mlinar , a bartender at Cangee 's Bar and Grille in Herkimer , said Myers frequently went in and had a bottle or two of Coors Light and left without speaking to anyone .
She said he was always alone and she did n't even know his name until police released his mugshot on Wednesday . NEWLINE
Cangee 's owner Candy Rellin called Myers " just an odd little man . " NEWLINE
" Everybody says ' Hi ' and waves and has small talk all the time , " said Fred Randall , 42 , a retired Air Force technical sergeant whose home is next to Myers ' .
"
But he would walk by , people would say ' Hi , ' and he would never return the gesture . " NEWLINE
Herkimer is a village of 7,700 named for the German immigrant family that settled in the western Mohawk Valley in the 1720s .
