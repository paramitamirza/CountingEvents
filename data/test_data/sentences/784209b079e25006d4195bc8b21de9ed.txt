Vanguard Group Fires Whistleblower Who Told TheStreet About Flaws in Customer Security
NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) --
The Vanguard Group , the world 's largest mutual fund company , has fired a whistleblower who shared information with TheStreet about deficiencies in the company 's customer account security . NEWLINE
According to the public database of stockbroker records kept by The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , or Finra , Karen Brock , a Client Relationship Administrator in Vanguard 's Scottsdale , Arizona office , is no longer employed by Vanguard or registered as a broker . NEWLINE
Finra 's public records said nothing about the reason for Brock 's termination .
But an unredacted version of her records supplied by a state securities regulator said that she had been discharged for " violation of Vanguard 's Professional Conduct Policy . " NEWLINE
The state records said that her last day at Vanguard was August 27 , 2015 .
Brock said in an interview that she was on family medical leave when she was fired . NEWLINE
Asked whether and why the firm had fired Brock , Vanguard spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock said in an email " I ca n't discuss a personnel decision .
" Sherlock had said in an earlier interview that the firm investigated Brock 's claims and remained " confident in our security practices and our efforts to keep our clients ' information and their assets safe . " NEWLINE
" This is the way companies silence people and scare them from coming forward when things are going wrong " internally , said Brock on Friday .
" This is in clear retaliation for the story coming out . " NEWLINE
On August 10 , TheStreet published an article that detailed Brock 's efforts since 2013 to get her bosses to address what she considers threats to the security of Vanguard 's 20 million customers . NEWLINE
Brock told TheStreet that Vanguard had been aware since 2013 that customers could log in to their accounts even if they entered typographical errors in their personal security answers .
In my own account at Vanguard , I have repeatedly tested her assertions and found them to be true .
On some occasions I have been able to get Vanguard to generate a link to a new password even after deliberately inserting typos into three security answers .
Customers still can access their accounts despite typos in security answers . NEWLINE
