In the frantic seconds after a bullet from a hunter 's rifle shattered a living room window and pierced their newborn 's skull , Jeremie and Stephanie Iverson struggled to understand what had happened . NEWLINE
As father and son quietly cuddled on the couch just past 7 on the evening of Sept. 25 , the baby 's head suddenly snapped back from the bullet 's impact . NEWLINE
Then came the blood , followed by a millisecond of heart - stopping silence when they were n't sure if Shayne , the son they brought home from the hospital two days earlier , was dead or alive . NEWLINE
A single , reassuring sound gave them their answer . NEWLINE
“ We heard him cry , and it was the best sound , ” said Jeremie Iverson , 42 , who lives with his wife and two other children in an area peppered with cornfields and silos just outside Saltsburg , Indiana County . NEWLINE
I 'm holding him , he 's sleeping , and we heard a loud pop , ” said Iverson , speaking in some of the greatest detail since the shooting happened . NEWLINE
“ I felt his head go back .
…
There was a lot of blood .
I freaked out .
Stephanie Iverson , 30 , wrapped the child 's head with towels as her husband regained composure and began making calls to 911 and state police . NEWLINE
Since then , the Iversons ' days have turned into weeks in Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh , talking to their son , holding his tiny hands , and praying that medicine will save the boy whose life forever changed with a tragedy that gained national attention . NEWLINE
The bullet exited through his eye socket , blinding him in that eye and possibly compromising vision in the other eye . NEWLINE
Their life is their family .
Stephanie will not leave that baby 's side , ” said family friend Karen Severini of Jeannette . NEWLINE
So on Monday , as Shayne marks his 1-month birthday , the Iversons will continue their vigil , hoping for the best . NEWLINE
A safe haven NEWLINE Surrounded by grassy hills and separated from neighbors by vast acres , Jeremie Iverson considered his family 's home along a winding , two - lane road dotted with campers and combines as their safe place . NEWLINE
It was a refuge where kids could run free and parents would know they would be OK. NEWLINE Jeremie , a carpenter , and Stephanie , an activities director at a nursing home , led a simple , happy life — two people whom friends described as “ completing each other .
After Shayne 's birth , Stephanie told Severini that “ we have everything we could ever ask for . ” NEWLINE
For the Iversons and those around them , the sound of hunters ' rifles was nothing new , especially in fall . NEWLINE
Yet “ it 's always been my fear of this happening , ” said Bill Nelson , 34 , father of a 3-year - old girl , who lives across the road from the Iversons on a 130-acre farm . NEWLINE
But most people , like the Iversons , accept that there will be hunters in the rural area . NEWLINE
“ It 's a fact of life .
You live out in the woods , and something might happen , ” said Anthony Buttekoff , 49 , whose father 's nearby home was struck twice by bullets . NEWLINE
The hunter whose bullet struck Shayne has not been identified .
The bullet had a “ one - in - a - million chance of hitting the home and the baby inside , ” said P.J. Hruska , president of Saltsburg Borough Council . NEWLINE
You 'd have a better chance of hitting the lottery 20 times in a row , ” he said . NEWLINE
No decision on whether to file charges can be made until authorities get the results of ballistics tests , a spokesman for Indiana County District Attorney Patrick Dougherty said . NEWLINE
None of that matters to the Iversons . NEWLINE
We 're not holding a grudge , ” Jeremie Iverson said . NEWLINE
They have more pressing concerns . NEWLINE “
To us , it does n't matter what they decide ; it wo n't change our situation . ” NEWLINE
Rough start NEWLINE From the start , life was n't easy for Shayne . NEWLINE
It was a difficult delivery .
He was breach , ”
Jeremie Iverson said .
Stephanie had a C - section and blood transfusions .
On the night of the shooting , as their son was loaded into a helicopter and flown to Children 's Hospital , the thought of losing him crossed the couple 's minds . NEWLINE
They had to remove a blood clot .
His brain was swelling , ” Iverson said . NEWLINE
It became a waiting game — to see how he weathered that first night and each thereafter . NEWLINE
On Thursday , the baby was back in surgery .
Doctors want to try to save the vision in his other eye and to repair facial damage . NEWLINE
The surgery “
went well but he will need more surgeries , ” his father wrote in a text message Thursday night following a long day for the family . NEWLINE
A lot of waiting , but we are happy with the results .
Still a long road to recovery , ” he said . NEWLINE
Helping thy neighbor NEWLINE
Since the shooting , the Iversons have not been to work .
Life revolves around the hospital and Shayne 's recovery . NEWLINE
Stephanie Iverson sleeps at the hospital .
Her husband shuttles back and forth , 70-plus miles , each day to help with their other children , Caden , 9 , and Gabi , 2 . NEWLINE
It 's been tough .
Friends have been helping out , ” Jeremie Iverson said .
“ You do what you have to do .
Almost immediately , the people of Saltsburg , population 845 , rallied behind the couple . NEWLINE
“ We 've sent a lot of prayers to that family .
If prayers were money , they would be rich , ” said Elizabeth Rocco , who became the town 's mayor in January . NEWLINE
The Iversons say they are humbled by the outpouring of support . NEWLINE
People have been sending cards and letters from all over , ”
Jeremie Iverson said .
Every day we get cards from people we do n't even know …
Ohio , New Jersey , North Carolina , New York .
People have held prayer services in New Mexico .
” NEWLINE “ We thank everyone .
...
It means a lot , ” Stephanie Iverson said . NEWLINE
The bills for Shayne 's care will be staggering , beginning with the $ 16,000 helicopter ride . NEWLINE
Two fundraisers are under way , including an online effort that raised almost $ 14,000 in 19 days .
More are planned , borough residents said . NEWLINE
Going forward , people will continue to pitch in any way they can , Rocco said . NEWLINE
“ We are a community that really embraces our neighbors , ” she said .
“ We step up to help those who need .
