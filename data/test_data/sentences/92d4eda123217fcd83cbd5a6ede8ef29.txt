Man arrested on suspicion of firearm charge after fatal shooting of Wichita 3-year - old
A 30-year - old man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal possession of a firearm after an apparent accidental shooting in which a 3-year - old Wichita boy died on Tuesday night , police said . NEWLINE
Jahmez Hunt , 3 , had retrieved the gun from cabinets above the refrigerator at their home at 525 E. Lincoln just before 5 p.m. Tuesday when he accidentally shot himself in the chest , Lt .
Jeff Gilmore said . NEWLINE
Jahmez died a short time later while undergoing surgery at Via Christi Hospital St. Francis , Gilmore said . NEWLINE
Mario T. Benjamin , 30 , the boyfriend of Jahmezs mother , was later booked into the Sedgwick County Jail on suspicion of criminal possession of a firearm . NEWLINE
Jahmez pulled a chair next to the kitchen counter , climbed onto the counter so he could reach cabinets above the refrigerator and reach into the cabinet for the handgun , Gilmore said . NEWLINE
It would appear the gun went off while he was standing on the kitchen cabinet before getting down to the floor , Gilmore said . NEWLINE
Benjamin and the mother of the four children in the house were asleep in a back bedroom for a long time at the house leading up to the shooting , Gilmore said .
An investigation revealed one of the children had shown the gun to the others earlier in the day . NEWLINE
Children , being curious as they are , went and located the gun again and played with the gun, Gilmore said . NEWLINE
Sisters ages 6 and 8 were playing in another room at the time of the shooting , he said , while Jahmez and his 7-year - old brother were in the kitchen . NEWLINE
The incident remains under investigation , he said , and charges related to the shooting remain possible . NEWLINE
Benjamin served prison time after being sentenced in 2007 for aggravated assault committed in 2006 , Kansas Department of Corrections records show .
He also has a domestic battery conviction for a crime committed in 2011 , records show .
He is being held on $ 5,000 bond . NEWLINE
He is a convicted felon and can not possess a firearm, Gilmore said of Benjamin . NEWLINE
Jahmezs mother did not realize there was a gun in the house , Gilmore said .
Benjamin lived there with her and the children . NEWLINE
Its so vitally important , with the curiosity of children , to keep the guns out of reach , unloaded and secured, Gilmore said . NEWLINE
Gun safes , locked boxes , trigger guards , and cables that prevent guns from being loaded are among the options gun owners have for keeping loaded weapons away from children . NEWLINE
Tuesdays shooting was the second time in three months that a Wichita child was shot to death at home .
On April 30 , a 19-month old boy died shortly after being shot in the chest after three young children found a gun . NEWLINE
In the April shooting , three children  ages 3 , 4 and 19 months  found a handgun stored in a nightstand at a house in the 1300 block of North Pennsylvania . NEWLINE
The 4-year - old pulled the trigger , and the bullet struck his younger brother , according to police .
The 33-year - old father of the children and his brother were in another room at the time . NEWLINE
That case remains under review .
