Police are having a hard time coming up with any suspect descriptions because they say witnesses are giving them conflicting accounts of what happened .
Floyd says whoever knows what happened needs to call police . NEWLINE
" A lot of people say , ' I do n't want to be a rat , I do n't want to be a snitch , ' but then again , look what you 're doing to society .
You 're just making it worse by not saying anything , " Floyd said . NEWLINE
Police tell us at least a dozen shots rang out .

Two had gunshot wounds to the arms and a legs .
Green was critically injured by a gunshot wound to the upper body .
A fourth victim drove herself to UK Hospital for treatment . NEWLINE
Police tell us one of the gunshot victims could be a juvenile .
Right now , police are n't releasing any other information about the victims . NEWLINE
Lexington Police say they need tips from the public to help them piece together the events that led up to the shooting . NEWLINE
" At this time we have very differing accounts of exactly what happened , " says Lexington Police Spokeswoman Sherelle Roberts .
" Some of our witnesses , some of the people involved , some of the people who were in the area all ca n't give us really consistent clues about what happened .
So we need people to call in so we can start matching up those clues and see if we can really piece the situation together . " NEWLINE
Roberts says there is not a consistent suspect or vehicle description right now .
They 're encouraging witnesses to reach out however they can , whether it is by phone or social media .
