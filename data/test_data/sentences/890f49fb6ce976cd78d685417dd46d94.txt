In December 2015 , the Myrtle Beach City Council passed an ordinance banning any new bars or clubs from opening in the area until a study is completed . NEWLINE
That study , they said , would take about a year to complete , so we are still waiting on findings . NEWLINE
Business owners , who spoke at a hearing last January , said they wanted to see change , but did n't think the temporary ban on new bars was fair . NEWLINE
At the time , the city planning director said they were still looking for a permanent solution . NEWLINE
We have reached out to the city council for an update in light of the shooting overnight . NEWLINE
Saturday morning , ABC 15 News spoke with some people in the community who were shaken up by the shooting . NEWLINE
Ron White , a longtime resident , said he came to Myrtle Beach Saturday morning to watch the sunrise with his family , but " ended up coming here in the dark , down the main avenue , driving our vehicle past a major crime scene . "
He continued , " They 've removed a lot of the family atmosphere from the beach by wiping out the pavilion .
It 's no surprise this area has become crime riddled to this point . " NEWLINE
Lori Orlowske works in Myrtle Beach , close to Pure Ultra Nightclub .
She said when she pulled in Saturday morning she saw the same usual thing - " beer bottles , beer cans , empty red Solo cups , styrofoam cups , food containers , just basically a trashed - up parking lots . " NEWLINE
Orlowske said she does n't know why the bars are open so late . NEWLINE
" Myrtle Beach needs to start breaking down on the laws .
Why are people out at the bars at 2:30 , 3 , 4 , 5 [ a.m. ] ?
They need to have a closing time .
If they 're not going to install a closing time for these businesses , shut them down .
I mean , just close them .
If you ca n't control them , just close them , " said Orlowske . NEWLINE
