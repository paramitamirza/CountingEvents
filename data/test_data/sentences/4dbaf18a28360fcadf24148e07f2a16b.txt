Local teenager victim of accidental gunshot
An accidental gunshot from a .45 caliber pistol Sunday left Gainesville High School senior Westley Suter feeling fortunate despite a wounded leg . NEWLINE
Westley said he was sitting in his pickup Sunday afternoon talking to his friend Allan McKenzie , who was sitting in his own truck in the parking lot outside the Gainesville Subway shop , when the accident occurred .
Westley was unloading a .45 ACP Springfield Armory tactical handgun he had used earlier that day while coyote hunting .
“ I was checking to make sure it was unloaded , ” Westley , 17 , told the Times .
“ I pulled it out of the holster , and it went off .

The hollow - point bullet went through the calf of his left leg , tearing through his jeans and rubber boots and exiting above his shin . NEWLINE
Stunned by the blast but charged with adrenaline , Westley jumped out of the truck and ran to Sage McGinnis , 18 , a first responder with the Gainesville Volunteer Fire Department , who was sitting in his truck in the same parking lot . NEWLINE
“
Now I can’t put any pressure on my leg at all , but right after it happened , I ran to Sage , and he got it wrapped up and called the ambulance , ”
Westley said Monday night . NEWLINE
He was taken to Baxter Regional Medical Center in Mountain Home , Arkansas , where a small army of friends and relatives converged on the trauma center as Westley was being treated there . NEWLINE
His mother , Jama Berry , hurried to the hospital from the family ’s home near Brixey , as did Westley ’s grandparents , Gainesville residents Mark and Rhonda Suter .
His maternal grandmother , Kay Doubek , and sister , Kirsten Suter , waited anxiously back home in Brixey for news that he was OK , Westley ’s mother said . NEWLINE
In the hospital , x - rays revealed Westley ’s amazing luck : the bullet had not hit a bone .
A couple of small pieces of the bullet remain in the tissue of his leg , but no surgery was needed .
The entry and exit wounds were treated , his leg was wrapped and Westley was issued a pair of crutches and sent home to recover , pausing just long enough in the trauma center hallway for a photo with friends and relatives who had gathered there . NEWLINE
His Facebook post reporting the accident and thanking everyone for their prayers and text messages “ and for being there at the emergency room ” garnered dozens of get - well wishes and expressions of thanks that his injuries weren’t worse . NEWLINE
Jama Berry told the Times , “ We are definitely blessed ” that he ’s going to be OK.
Responding to one Facebook commenter ’s post that “ you learn from your mistakes , ”
Jama replied , “
Let ’s hope he does .
I’m not sure how many more lessons my heart can take . ”
