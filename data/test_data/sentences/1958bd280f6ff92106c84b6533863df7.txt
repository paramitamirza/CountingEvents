Firefighters    arrived within two minutes of the 9 - 1 - 1 call to discover NEWLINE heavy fire showing    from the first floor of a 2,768 square - foot two - story NEWLINE single family home . NEWLINE

The invalid woman 's adult female caretaker had earlier tucked her    in NEWLINE for the night , sought to make her more comfortable , and then retired    to NEWLINE her own first - floor accommodations in the rear of the house . NEWLINE
Just    after 11:00 PM , the caretaker heard the woman scream for help , and NEWLINE fearing    for her medical well - being , began calling 9 - 1 - 1 . NEWLINE
As the caretaker 's call    was connected to LAFD Firefighter/Dispatchers , NEWLINE she completed her journey    to the front room , only to be confronted with NEWLINE flames . NEWLINE
With fire    beginning to spread rapidly in the room , the caretaker NEWLINE attempted to move the    physically infirm woman to a wheelchair as several NEWLINE properly functioning smoke    alarms began to sound throughout the NEWLINE Victorian - style home . NEWLINE
The    caretaker 's repeated attempts were unsuccessful however , and she NEWLINE was    ultimately driven back by the heat , smoke and flames before being NEWLINE forced to    flee the home unscathed . NEWLINE
Firefighters pulled the invalid woman from the    blaze with blinding NEWLINE speed , but not before she sustained massive second- and    third - degree NEWLINE burns from the swift - moving fire , which was confined to the room    of NEWLINE origin and extinguished in just nineteen minutes . NEWLINE

No    other injuries were reported . NEWLINE
There were no security bars or other    obvious impairment to egress from NEWLINE the home , which was not equipped with fire    sprinklers . NEWLINE
