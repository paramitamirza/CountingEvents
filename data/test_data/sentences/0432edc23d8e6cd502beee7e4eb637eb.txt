“
What do you say about something like that ?
That somebody fires indiscriminately through a door .
They don’t know who ’s on the other side , " Turnbull said . "
Whether they knew who ’s on the other side or not , you put a lot of people ’s lives at risk -- and for what ?

There ’s really no justification for it .
