Wildfire Scorches Three Acres near Forest Lawn in L.A.
On Thursday , August 24 , 2006 at 5:15 p.m. , 26 companies of Los Angeles firefighters , three LAFD rescue ambulances , one LAFD arson unit , four LAFD helicopters , one LAFD water tender , one LAFD EMS battalion captain , five LAFD battalion chief officer command teams , one LAFD division chief officer command team , as well as two hand crews , one supervisor and a battalion chief from the Los Angeles County Fire Department , one company and one battalion chief from the Burbank Fire Department , one company from the Warner Brothers Studio Fire Department and Griffith Park Rangers , all under the direction of LAFD Assistant Chief Michael Fulmis responded to a brush fire near 6711 Forest Lawn Drive near Forest Lawn/Hollywood Hills . NEWLINE
Firefighters arrived quickly in response to timely reports of a vegetation fire to discover a quarter - acre of grass burning in steep and inaccessible terrain of the Hollywood Hills immediately southeast of Griffith Park . NEWLINE
More than 100 ground - based firefighters were soon joined by a quartet of Los Angeles Fire Department helicopters that effectively flanked the flames with repeated precision water drops . NEWLINE
Because shifting winds of nearly ten miles - per - hour caused the fire to nearly double in size in a short period of time , bringing flames closer to heavy brush , high voltage power lines and homes more than a half - mile away , additional LAFD engine companies were briskly deployed in the role of structure protection in the sparsely populated surrounding hillsides . NEWLINE
With nearly 200 personnel from a multitude of agencies soon in place , LAFD command staff utilized pre - plans and worked in close concert with LAFD firefighter/pilots to determine and monitor real - time fire behavior for the duration of the blaze , which was brought under control in little more than an hour after consuming three acres of brush and grass in remote and rugged terrain . NEWLINE
No structures or power lines were damaged , and there were no evacuations or injuries .
Though Warner Brothers Studio and Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills Memorial Park remain the closest identifiable landmarks to the blaze , neither were endangered by the fire . NEWLINE
Firefighters will remain on site throughout the night to prevent and flare - ups .
The cause of the blaze remains under investigation .
