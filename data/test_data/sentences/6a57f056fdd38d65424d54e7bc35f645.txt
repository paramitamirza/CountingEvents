A month and a half after a shooting at Los Altos Skate Park left one person dead and six injured , police told a news conference Friday afternoon that the man who shot and killed a 17-year - old at a Northeast Albuquerque skate park did so in self - defense . NEWLINE
Police said cellphone video of the encounter shows that the teen who was shot and killed , Jaquise Lewis , was one of the shooters firing at the skaters .
However , they do not believe he was the first one in his group to fire shots . NEWLINE
The fight began after members of one group asked to borrow a couple of skateboards from the other group , said officer Tanner Tixier , a spokesman for the Albuquerque Police Department .
The first two skateboards were returned , but when someone asked for the third back , a fist fight broke out . NEWLINE
It turned into a gunfight . NEWLINE
Tixier said there was no indication the shooting was race - related or gang - related . NEWLINE
Stills taken from a cellphone video depict many people fighting in a crowd before four muzzle flashes are seen , indicating shots were fired in the air .
Two of the injured skateboarders – one wearing a yellow shirt and the other in red – can be seen in the video , and Tixier said one man in his 20s is now paralyzed and just gave his first statement to police at the beginning of the week . NEWLINE
“ We do believe that Jaquise Lewis was the one that fired those rounds against the other young man in yellow , ” Tixier said .
“ We can’t see everything in the video , so we can’t say 100 percent , but we’re fairly confident that this is a picture of Jaquise Lewis shooting the individual in the yellow shirt .
Detectives have identified the man who they believe shot Lewis but are not pressing charges .
He was not injured in the shooting . NEWLINE
“ We have had four meetings with the district attorneys showing them what we know at this point and showing them the full video , ” Tixier said .
We’ve all come to the conclusion at this point that Jaquise Lewis was shot in self - defense .
Tixier asked for additional witnesses to come forward with information and said detectives have mostly only been able to interview the skaters , not anyone who was part of Lewis’ group of friends . NEWLINE
No guns were recovered from the scene , he said . NEWLINE
In an autopsy report obtained by the Journal , the Office of the Medical Investigator ruled Lewis was shot in the left back and left upper arm and “ the range of fire for both injuries is best classified as distant .
” NEWLINE Police said a person does not have to be facing another for a shooting to be considered self - defense . NEWLINE
He was walking back toward another group , ” Tixier said .
He had already showed propensity to not only fire rounds but also threatened numerous individuals with a gun , and he was rushing back in the direction where there was a group of people .
Lewis should not have been at the park that night , according to Larry Gallegos , a spokesman for the Bernalillo County Youth Services Center . NEWLINE
Lewis was under house arrest after being charged with negligent use of a deadly weapon and unlawful carrying of a handgun by a person under 19 in early March , according to his order of release . NEWLINE
Being on house arrest means the CCP ( community custody program ) officer would have to give him permission to leave the house , ” Gallegos said .
The night of the shooting , he did not call for permission to leave the house . ” NEWLINE
If Lewis had requested permission to leave the house , he would have had to be accompanied by a guardian .
Lewis’ grandparents were acting as his guardians .
They refused requests for an interview . NEWLINE
On March 1 , Lewis was at a friend ’s house learning how to disassemble a gun , according to a court document filed in the 2nd Judicial District Court .
Witnesses told police the gun went off and Lewis’ 14-year - old friend was struck in the buttocks by the bullet . NEWLINE
Lewis took off but later returned to the scene and cooperated with police , according to the document . NEWLINE
He told police he would show them where he had thrown the gun , but they were unable to find it , according to the document . NEWLINE
Lewis’ friend told police it was a black Ruger 9mm handgun . NEWLINE
Police have not found any of the guns fired in the Los Altos shooting , although they found casings .
Tixier refused to say what kinds of guns police believe were fired . NEWLINE
The assistant district attorney who was prosecuting the charge against Lewis of negligent use of a deadly weapon wonders if there is a connection between the shootings . NEWLINE “
I’m certainly wondering whether the gun used in the case I was prosecuting was the same as in the skate park shooting , ” Alma Rosa Delgado said . NEWLINE
An attorney for Lewis’ grandparents said he does not believe the March 1 shooting is relevant to Lewis ’s death . NEWLINE “
If they’re taking the position today that suggests Jaquise Lewis died from someone acting in self - defense , give us the entirety of the evidence , let us , the community , judge this process , ” said Ahmad Assed , a defense attorney representing the family .
“ Don’t let APD call the shots in this conversation .
The African - American community deserves better ; the whole community deserves better .
Assed said he requested all pertinent documents , including police reports , recordings and documentation of evidence from the Police Department , under the Inspection of Public Records Act .
He said he was told his request was too burdensome and could not be completed at this time . NEWLINE
It ’s been seven or eight weeks since this young man died , and we don’t have anyone charged in this process , ” Assed said .
They presented an opinion based on certain photos , I want to be able to look at the entire video . ” NEWLINE
Tixier said police are not showing the full video at this time in the hopes that some of the people identified in the stills will come forward as witnesses . NEWLINE “
If we show the video , there will be no way for us to corroborate if what they told us is accurate , or if they’re just reciting back what they saw in the video , ” he said .
“ We need to hold it so we can compare their statements to us with it . ”
