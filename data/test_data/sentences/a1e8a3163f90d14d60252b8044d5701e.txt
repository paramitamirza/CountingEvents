As firefighters arrived , they reported a two - story , multi - unit residence ( a four - plex on each floor ) , with smoke showing .
Firefighters , using thermal imaging cameras , were able to locate the fire inside of a wall , which had then traveled up the inside of the wall and took hold in the attic .
Firefighters began an aggressive attack from the interior of the structure as fellow firefighters on the roof cut ventilation holes .
Due to the aggressive fire attack , and well coordinated ventilation efforts , 95 firefighters were able to control the fire in just 17 minutes .
An investigation has determined that a wall heater , which had been left on when the occupants EMPTY had gone out , started the fire and then traveled to the attic .
