BOISE - A Kuna man is recovering in the hospital after an accidental shooting left him paralyzed .
The Ada County Sheriff 's Office says on November 18th , 20-year - old Jacob Tewalt was driving around listening to music with his friends .
The car came to a stop in a Hubbard and Meridian roads neighborhood .
It was during that stop the sheriff 's office says a 14-year - old in the seat behind Tewalt had a gun in his lap that accidentally went off . NEWLINE
The bullet went through the seat and hit Tewalt in the back .
Ever since that day , Tewalt has been in a hospital bed recovering .
Doctors says he still has more than a year left before he 'll be done with physical therapy .
Tewalt says he 'll probably never be able to walk again , but he 's not letting that dampen his spirits . NEWLINE
" It 's a bump in the road , but we 'll relearn how to do stuff and pretty soon it will just be normal , " Tewalt said . NEWLINE
Tewalt tells KTVB that November 18th was just a regular night and that he had hung out with those same friends a number of times in the past and never had any issues . NEWLINE
" I felt the concussion of it hitting the seat and then once I realized that I could n't get out of my car or move my legs .
I could feel the pain and the burning and the pressure on the left side , " Tewalt said . NEWLINE
Tewalt was rushed to the hospital where he spent two - and - a - half - hours in surgery and another three days in the intensive care unit .
His family was by his side the whole time . NEWLINE
" They took 30 percent of his kidney , the end of his small intestine .
The bullet stopped right before it went through his large intestine .
It did hit his spine , " Diana Boyll , Jacob 's mother , said . NEWLINE
The incident left him paralyzed from the waist down .
He says one day he may gain some sensation and feeling back in his legs , but does n't think he 'll ever walk again .
However , he 's not giving up . NEWLINE
" Eventually , I would like to try and get a car and get it all set up and stuff so that I can get back to having a semi normal life , " Tewalt said . NEWLINE
The family is doing everything they can to ensure that Jacob does live a normal life .
They 've already started looking into ways to make their home wheelchair accessible . NEWLINE "
At 20 you should be picking out a car , not a wheelchair , " Boyll said . NEWLINE
He and his family say the shooting may have been an accident , but it all could have been prevented with gun safety and education . NEWLINE
" The results are very real , and it does n't just affect the person unfortunately that gets the bullet , it has affected our entire family , " Boyll said .
" It is a bump in the road , but it 's a permanent bump in the road . " NEWLINE
A permanent bump that Jacob hopes will be a lesson for others . NEWLINE
" Make sure you know what you 're doing when you 're handling a firearm of any type , " Tewalt said . NEWLINE
The Ada County Sheriff 's Office says the 14-year - old boy has been charged with misdemeanor counts of injuring another by careless handling and discharge of a firearm .
The sheriff 's office added there is no evidence of alcohol or drug use . NEWLINE
Jacob 's family has set up a GoFundMe account to help with medical bills and house improvements . NEWLINE
