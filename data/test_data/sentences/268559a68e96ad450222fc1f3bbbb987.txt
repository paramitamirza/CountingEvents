Shelby teen ’s death appears to be ‘
tragic accident’ with loaded hunting gun
SHELBY –
A 15-year - old Town of Shelby boy who died in his home Friday was the apparent victim of an accidental discharge of a shotgun used for hunting , authorities in Orleans County said on Saturday . NEWLINE
Jacob A. Stahl , a sophomore at Medina High School , died in his home on Salt Works Road at about 5:30 p.m. Friday , Sheriff Scott D. Hess said . NEWLINE
An avid hunter , Jacob was looking at the shotgun in an upstairs bedroom with a 16-year - old friend when the gun accidentally went off , firing a shot that killed Jacob , authorities told The Buffalo News . NEWLINE
There is no indication of foul play , and the other teen – whose name has not been released – has “ fully cooperated ” in the ongoing investigation , the Sheriff ’s Office said . NEWLINE
So far , police have not disclosed any specifics about what caused the gun to go off , or who was handling the weapon when it fired . NEWLINE “
It ’s so sad , ” District Attorney Joseph V. Cardone said .
From everything I have been told so far , it sounds like an accident – 100 percent . ” NEWLINE
Cardone said he will have detailed discussions with police and Jacob ’s family before deciding whether to present the case to a grand jury .
The Sheriff ’s Office said investigators are “
reasonably certain ” that the death was a “ tragic accident that resulted from the careless handling of a loaded firearm .
According to Hess , a 911 call came from the boy ’s home in the 5000 block of Salt Works Road Friday , and when deputies and first responders arrived , the teen was dead . NEWLINE
Medina School officials will have grief counselors available to talk with students all this week , Superintendent Jeffrey Evoy told a reporter Saturday .
The high school has 645 students . NEWLINE
We opened the high school today and we’ve already had some students come in , ”
Evoy said .
This is a small , close - knit school community , and this is an absolute tragedy .
People are in a state of shock .
Jacob ’s friends knew him as “ someone who loved the outdoors and loved hunting , ” Evoy said .
He had a close group of friends , and they talked about hunting a lot .
Cardone , who has been the county ’s chief prosecutor since 1992 , said he has seen “ too many ” cases in which young people were killed through the unsafe handling of hunting weapons . NEWLINE
Cardone said he was reminded of a November 2003 incident in which a 17-year - old Albion boy accidentally shot and killed his 16-year - old best friend with an arrow fired by a hunting bow while the two were target shooting . NEWLINE “
In this county , we have a lot of hunters with a lot of guns in a lot of households , ”
Cardone said . NEWLINE “
Young people have to be taught that you need to be very careful .
Something like this has a tremendous impact , not only on the young person who is killed , but on the other person who was involved .
And their families .
