This Is What Happened To The Guy Who Berated This Innocent Chick - Fil - A Employee ( Video )
Adam Smith , who was fired from his job as the CFO of Vante , Inc. , is now living in an RV and is on food stamps . NEWLINE
According to Smith , Vante fired him after he posted a video on Youtube berating a Chik - fil - A employee about the company ’s policy towards homosexuals . NEWLINE
In 2012 , Smith filmed a video while going through a drive - thru to receive free water .
As he pulled up to the window to pick up his order , he started berating the young lady working inside . NEWLINE
Smith said , “ Chick - Fil - A is a hateful corporation .
I don’t know how you live with yourself and work here .
I don’t understand it .
This is a horrible corporation with horrible values .
You deserve better .

The Chik - fil - A worker responded in a very professional manner and never lost her composure .
The interaction only lasted about thirty seconds , but Smith made sure the damage was permanent by posting the video to Youtube . NEWLINE
Smith told ABC News that when he got back to work , the receptionist said , “ Adam , what did you do ?
The voicemail is completely full , and it ’s full of bomb threats .

Smith was fired later that day .
He claims that he was making $ 200,000 annually and had over $ 1 million in stock options with the medical device manufacturer . NEWLINE

In the following months , Smith and his family lost their house and were forced to move into a mobile home .
He managed to get hired as a CFO in Portland , Oregon , but was fired two weeks later after his boss found out about the video . NEWLINE
