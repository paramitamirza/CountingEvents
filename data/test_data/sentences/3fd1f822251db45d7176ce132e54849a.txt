The officers’ mixed responses , however , show how difficult it will be for the company to correct the perception — EMPTY created by a single employee acting independently — that Whataburger is anti - police . NEWLINE
Officer Michael Magovern told Fox4 News that he still loves Whataburger and doesn’t want to throw the company “ under the bus ” ( although he gladly enjoyed a meal at Dairy Queen after the incident ) .

It really strikes a nerve personally and professionally because maybe he ’s joking or maybe he ’s not , but how do we trust that individual or that company to cook anyone ’s food now ? ” NEWLINE
We , the Tweeple NEWLINE People on twitter responded more positively , however , with many showing their support for the burger company and lauding its quick response on social media .

How to Handle Rogue Employees NEWLINE
So what should you do if you find yourself in Whataburger ’s very awkward position , with your hard work and stellar reputation sullied by the carelessness of a single employee ?
Follow the fast food company ’s lead . NEWLINE
First , be careful what you tweet .
People will demand engagement , statements , and explanations .
Do apologize but do not say anything certain until you have a plan for finding out what happened .
Make sure the company ’s response is unified , consistent , and coming from an appropriate person . NEWLINE
Try not to get caught up in the urgency of the moment .
Even an emergency PR situation benefits from a little planning — you may not have much time to mull it over , but do carefully consider your words before speaking as you may risk more blunders .
And what a bummer that would be . NEWLINE
