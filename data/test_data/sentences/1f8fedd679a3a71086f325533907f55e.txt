Man shot while hunting rabbits with young son in Madison County
A Morgan County man was treated and released from an Athens hospital Saturday hours after his 9-year - old son accidentally shot him while rabbit hunting in Madison County , authorities said Monday . NEWLINE
The shooting occurred on a farm just outside Ila off Georgia Highway 174 , where responding deputies found medics treating the man for a wound to his leg around the knee , according to a Madison County Sheriff ’s report . NEWLINE
Department of Natural Resources Ranger Shane Sartor investigated the shooting and determined the son accidentally shot his father . NEWLINE
“
The dogs were actually chasing a rabbit .
The dad saw the rabbit coming and told the son to get ready .
We can’t surmise how the gun went off , but the 9 year old probably got excited , ” Sartor said , saying the son apparently didn’t have the safety on . NEWLINE
The gun blast occurred anywhere from 10 to 20 yards from the father , according to Sartor .
However , neither the father or son could show officers exactly where they were standing when the shooting occurred .
The son was carrying a 20-gauge double barrel shotgun loaded with a field load . NEWLINE
The father was wearing thickly woven hunting pants and the pellets didn’t penetrate deeply into his flesh , Sartor said . NEWLINE
Sartor checked on the father again Sunday and the father said he was doing fine and that the pellets did not damage his knee cap .
