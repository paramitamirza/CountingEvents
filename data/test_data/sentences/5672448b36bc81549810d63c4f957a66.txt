The superintendent of schools was unaware of problems between the two young men , who both just graduated .
As this community is reeling from the tragedy , police say they will increase patrols at the school parking lot , where they believe Porter planned the attack . NEWLINE
" We 're still investigating that part , but it is believed that yes , it was planned , somewhat .
We do n't know what degree yet , " said Sgt .
Tim Stuart of the Ava Police Department . NEWLINE
" We have a lot of kids that gather there , " said Dr. Nancy Lawler , Superintendent of Ava Schools .
" It 's the spot for them to gather on weekend nights .
We 've debated whether to close it off or not , and we have not done that , mainly because it 's a very visible area .
There 's a ton of traffic that goes by .
It 's the main route through town , so it 's policed a lot by the police and just by people in general .
So we would rather our kids hang out in town where they can be seen than to close everything off and make it more difficult for them to have a hangout spot . " NEWLINE
Payton Esterline is recovering in a Springfield hospital .
Dr. Lawler says Paul Porter is n't the only suicide recently .
The district lost another student this spring .
