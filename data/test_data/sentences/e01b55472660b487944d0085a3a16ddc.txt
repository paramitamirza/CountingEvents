A $ 1 million lawsuit filed by fired Grand Rapids city clerk Lauri Parks against the city and its mayor was dismissed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Janet Neff .
Parks , who was appointed in 2008 and fired five years later , sued the city and Mayor George Heartwell alleging that she was fired because of the city 's " pattern and practice of eliminating women and minorities from Defendant 's workforce , " the lawsuit said .
Parks is the granddaughter of Grand Rapids ' first African - American mayor , the late Rev. Lyman S. Parks .
Her annual salary was around $ 95,000 .
The city contended that her work performance led to her firing .
Her position is one of four that serves at the will of the City Commission , which makes the appointments . "
Ms. Parks ' performance evaluations were negative beginning at least as early as the evaluation of 2011 , " attorney Laura Amtsbuechler , representing the city , said in her motion to dismiss the case .
She said two city commissioners began working with her to improve her performance and suggested that she seek guidance from outside advisers and other appointed officials .
She did not , the city said .
In September 2013 , after a third year of unsatisfactory evaluations , she was offered the opportunity to resign with six months of severance pay or take another job with the city , Amtsbuechler said .
Parks did not respond to a deadline and she threatened legal action , the city said .
" It is a matter of public record that Ms. Parks has been replaced by an African American female , Darlene O'Neal , who had served as Deputy Clerk during Ms. Parks ' service as the Clerk , " Amtsbuechler wrote .
