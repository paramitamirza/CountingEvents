Watch Peter D’Oench ’s report on the shooting NEWLINE Kristal White , who lives in the apartment complex with her 7-year - old and 12-year - old daughters , told CBS4 ’s Peter D’Oench , “ We just heard gunshots and the kids started running .
It sounded like Boom , boom , boom .
The 4th of July .
It was scary .
” NEWLINE
“ I think it ’s unfortunate that this happened in this close - knit community , ” White said .
“ It is very unfortunate that we lose lives every day down here .
I hope it won;t be one of my kids one day .
Nobody ’s going to come forward and say anything .
I just hope people keep their children close and pray for them .
” NEWLINE A woman , who did not want to be identified for fear she would become a target , says she heard dozens of shots fired and immediately took cover with her three - year - old great grandchild by her side .
The one thing on her mind was the mass shooting in Liberty City that occurred almost two weeks ago where a total of nine people were shot when bullets went through windows and walls . NEWLINE
“ It ’s a continuous thing and I don’t like it but unfortunately I can move so we either have to accept it because it doesn’t look like the authorities are able to stop them , ” she said . NEWLINE

Drop my kids off and pray that they remain safe , ” said Gabe Moore .
