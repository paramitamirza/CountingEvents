The owner of a South Side nightclub where seven people were injured early Thursday when gunfire erupted inside during a rap video release party says nothing like it has ever occurred at the club and he is conducting a review of all security measures . NEWLINE
Police said three people pulled out handguns and started firing shots both inside and outside Mr. G ’s Supper Club and Entertainment Center at 87th and Ashland about 1:13 a.m. Thursday . NEWLINE
The Auburn Gresham neighborhood shooting was gang - related , police News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro said .
A promotional poster indicated rap artists Nino , King Samson and Lil Mouse performed at the event . NEWLINE
A YouTube video for the Lil Mouse song “ I m 4real ” shows the rapper and his crew wearing apparel emblazoned with the phrase “ no talking ” — an apparent reference to the no - snitch code that governs much of the city ’s gang violence .
The song lyrics feature gratuitous allusions to gun violence . NEWLINE
Three people — a 19-year - old woman , 21-year - old man and 23-year - old man — were driven to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn with gunshot wounds , Alfaro said .
The 19-year - old woman was shot seven times , according to dispatch reports .
All three were listed in “
stable ” condition . NEWLINE
Two men , ages 20 and 21 , were in “ stable ” condition after one was taken by ambulance and another driven to Holy Cross Hospital , police said . NEWLINE
Two other men , ages 26 and 36 , were also in “
stable ” condition after being driven to Little Company of Mary Hospital and Health Care Center , Alfaro said . NEWLINE
But police on the scene said the exact number of injured was hard to determine because a handful of the wounded were driven to hospitals by people they knew . NEWLINE
In a statement issued later Thursday morning , the club ’s owner , Gene Linton , said that for 23 years he has “
earned the reputation as one of the most respected businessmen in Cook County .
Never has any incident of this magnitude occurred at the establishment .
” NEWLINE
Linton ’s statement said the “ senseless ” incident “ initiated on the exterior of our building after hours ” and he is conducting a review of all security measures at the nightclub in conjunction with the police investigation . NEWLINE
Additionally , Linton said , “ We ask that the general public join us in praying for the victims of this cowardly act .
We also have pledged our full and complete cooperation with the Chicago Police Department in its investigation… ” NEWLINE
No one was in custody Thursday morning as Area South detectives investigate . NEWLINE
