Gun sellers at the Erie Sport Store say there are ways to keep kids safe around guns .
While it 's not against the law to have a loaded weapon in your car , if you have a concealed carry permit , they believe an accident like this one could have been avoided if the gun was in a lock box , had a trigger lock , or was stored separately from the ammunition .
" That is probably the biggest thing , to have that gun locked up with a box or with a trigger lock of some sort , " said Todd Meeker , Outdoor Manager at the Erie Sport Store .
" Especially around children , they 're curious , they just like to look at things , " he added .
