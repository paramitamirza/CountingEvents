Miami - Dade Fire Rescue battles second alarm grass fire threatening homes in Southwest Dade
At approximately 2:00 pm Friday , EMPTY Miami Dade Fire Rescue companies were dispatched for a report of a grass fire at SW 227th Ave and 232nd Street .
Upon approaching the scene , responding units noted smoke and a rapidly spreading grass fire on a 30 acre farm with extensive mango groves and other crops .
Additional units were quickly dispatched ; a second alarm assignment was ultimately called approximately an hour into the firefight . NEWLINE
The property at risk included a 2-story wood - frame home and an aircraft hanger on the periphery of a private aircraft landing strip .
The hanger housed two aircraft and posed an additional threat due to fuel stored on site .
Two other homes bordering the property were evacuated due to their proximity to the active fire .
Firefighters worked feverishly to protect all four structures .
Flames approached within 20 feet of the on - site residence but were turned back by the efforts of MDFR crews . NEWLINE
This was a particularly challenging fire not only due to the extent and intensity of the fire and the need to protect exposures but also because of the extremely dry conditions and the involvement of multiple vehicles and a boat .
In addition , the closest fire hydrant was six miles from the scene .
Firefighters obtained water to extinguish the fire and protect exposures by drafting from a nearby canal .
MDFR 's Air Rescue North and South units were instrumental once again in fighting the blaze , providing numerous tactical water drops that were key in containing the stubborn fire .
MDFR 's Brush Truck was also utilized to the fullest extent .
MDFR is the only Fire Rescue Department in the county to have this specialized resource . NEWLINE
Approximately 60 MDFR firefighters and additional Florida Forestry personnel were successful in containing the blaze after approximately three hard - fought hours .
Rangers and firefighters from Everglades National Park also assisted in controlling the western front of the fire . NEWLINE
No injuries were reported and all evacuees have been permitted to return to their homes .
MDFR personnel remain on scene to monitor for rekindling .
The cause of the fire remains under investigation .
