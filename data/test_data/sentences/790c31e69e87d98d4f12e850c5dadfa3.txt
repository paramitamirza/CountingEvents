Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Jessie got into an argument with Weekly about her new boyfriend at Weekly ’s home , on Drane Field Road in Lakeland . NEWLINE
" She was frustrated with the child and as a result , she did n't want the child to mess up the relationship she had with the boyfriend , " Judd said . NEWLINE
Family members said Meredith was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and was recently put on medication . NEWLINE
" She was your friend one minute , and the next minute she could snap .
But bipolarism is no excuse for murder , " said Weekly 's sister - in - law , Janice Weekly . NEWLINE
Investigators said Jessie ’s story changed several times after she reported the two missing .
She first told authorities that the two were in Georgia , then claimed that she killed them in self - defense , deputies said . NEWLINE
" She supposedly gets the knife from her father after the father is fighting and slashing at her with the knife and accidentally stabs the 6-year - old .
None of the evidence supports this , " Judd said . NEWLINE
Detectives said Jessie had no injuries to suggest that she had struggled with her father . NEWLINE
" He really cared for his granddaughter , " said Mark Weekly 's brother , Mike Weekly .
" I do n't believe he would ever hurt her .
It 's terrible that this had to happen . " NEWLINE
" I have no idea why anyone would do anything like that , even their 6-year old daughter , " said Mark Weekly 's niece , Crystal Stahl .
" I mean , it 's just a disgusting thing anyone could do to any child or even their father . " NEWLINE "
She had planned this .
She had the furniture covered , is what we heard , " said Mark Weekly 's sister - in - law , Gaye Weekly .
" I want her to have to pay for it .
I mean , I do n't want her getting off with a lawyer putting her in a mental institution , because this is premeditated .
Mental illness you do n't plan out something , you just act .
She planned this out . " NEWLINE
Deputies serving a search warrant said they found bloodstained floors and furniture with slash marks . NEWLINE
Judd said the house reeked of a foul odor , and Jessie claimed that there had been a dead raccoon under her porch . NEWLINE
" Nothing is more horrific than the murder of a child , except when it ’s done by a parent , " Judd said . NEWLINE
Judd said a gun and a knife were used in the killings , but they are waiting for the results of autopsies to determine how Mark Weekly and Meredith died . NEWLINE
" This is the face and ( these are ) the eyes of a cold - blooded murderer that not only murdered them on the 18th of July , but left them in the residence for many days , " Judd said . NEWLINE
A friend of Mark Weekly ’s said Weekly helped take care of Jessie 's daughter . NEWLINE
" He would rather you take his life than mess with that baby , " Fred Poore Jr. said .
