ROY —
A Roy couple and their two young children were found dead inside their home on Father 's Day in an apparent triple murder - suicide . NEWLINE
Family members made the horrific discovery about 10 p.m. Sunday , finding the bodies of Russell Smith , his wife , Shawna Smith , and their two children , 6-year - old Tylee and 2-year - old Blake . NEWLINE
" Shawna is a wonderful , loving mother .
She 's my daughter and she 's my heart .
And my babies … they did n't deserve this , they did n't deserve this , " an emotional Sheila Pruitt , Shawna Smith 's mother , said in tears Monday . NEWLINE
Roy police said it appears the father shot his wife and children before killing himself . NEWLINE
" Our preliminary investigation shows that the cause of death is from gunshots .
Russell 's gunshot wound looks to be self - inflicted , " said Roy Police Lt .
Kevin Smith .
" At this point it looks like a murder - suicide situation .
We 're not looking for anybody else at this point and time . " NEWLINE
Neighbors say what makes the tragedy even more mysterious is that the Smiths were nice and polite and had no history of domestic violence .
Police say they had never been called to the house before . NEWLINE
" As far as the family is concerned , we 've had no priors at this house before with either of the individuals .
We 've never been to the address for any reason for the police department , " the lieutenant said .
" This is a very quiet family .
There 's no indication they 've ever fought before .
Just kind of keep to themselves . " NEWLINE
Police did not release many details about the crime scene Monday , including where in the house the bodies were found or whether there were any signs of a struggle .
Whether any kind of note was left was still being investigated , said Smith , who is not related to the family . NEWLINE
A family member last had contact with Shawna Smith about 1 p.m. Sunday through a text message , according to the lieutenant .
After not hearing from her the rest of the day , he went to their house , 2106 W. 4750 South , that evening and found the family dead . NEWLINE

But police say neighbors did not hear any gunshots or fighting before that . NEWLINE
Pruitt said her daughter and son - in - law had been together for a long time . NEWLINE
" I do n't know what happened , " she said in a very soft voice . NEWLINE
Tylee was about to enter first grade in the fall and loved dance and softball , Pruitt recalled .
She remembered Blake as " so happy and loving and sweet . " NEWLINE
A woman who lives across the street from the Smiths , who asked not to be identified , described the family as very caring , loving , " great people " who would always ask her how they could help out . NEWLINE "
It 's hard to believe that we wo n't see them again .
We exchanged gifts at Christmas and they 'd come over and talk to us when we went anywhere and asked us to take care of their house , " she said .
" Very very shocking to hear this . " NEWLINE
Commenting on the Smiths ' daughter , she said , " Tylee was absolutely a doll .
She had red curly hair .
Darling , absolutely adorable . " NEWLINE
