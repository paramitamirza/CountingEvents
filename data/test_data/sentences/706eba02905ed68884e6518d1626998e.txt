Courtney Fischer ( @CourtneyABC13 ) July 20 , 2016 NEWLINE UPDATE : 2 in custody tied to 3rdWard shooting .
HPD : driver of silver truck admitted to " being involved " # abc13 pic.twitter.com/LBocG1PWKk — Courtney Fischer ( @CourtneyABC13 ) July 20 , 2016 NEWLINE Houston police say it 's a tragic case of mistaken identity , when a 33-year - old man was shot and killed in the Third Ward Wednesday morning .
Two people are now in custody after the shooting on Napoleon Street and Rosalie Street .
Crime scene tape blocked the intersection of Rosalie and Napoleon , a few blocks from University of Houston 's campus .
Neighbors , friends and family took in the scene many described as " all too familiar " as police investigated .
It was just before 4 am when shots rang out .
Friends identified the man killed as Demarcus Tucker .
He died before paramedics arrived."The violence has got to stop .
The crime has got to stop , " said neighbor , Tekia Wilker .
Police say Tucker was not the killer 's intended target."There was a possibility this was a mistaken identity , " said HPD , Thomas Simmons .
Investigators believe the shooter was after someone he made a drug deal with hours earlier , not Tucker."There was some kind of drug transaction that went on that did n't happen
quite the way it was supposed to happen , " Simmons said .
" Very tragic scene , unfortunately."People in the Third Ward say they 're not surprised to hear about another deadly shooting."They are killing all the children , " said Glen Olezene , who lives nearby."It does n't make sense .
Everybody fighting against each other instead of helping each other , " said Wilker .
But how much can one family take?Tucker 's younger brother was killed two weeks earlier .
Daquarius Tucker , 19 , was one of five people shot on July 4th during a block party in the Fourth Ward .
So far , no arrests have been made in that case .
One man was arrested this morning , less than a mile from where Demarcus Tucker was gunned down .
Originally , two people were taken into custody but police say it 's likely only one will be charged with Tucker 's death .
That man 's name has not been released yet .
