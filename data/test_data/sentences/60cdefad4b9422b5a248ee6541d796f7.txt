Five men shot at party near SVSU , shooter still on the loose
UPDATE : ( 09/12/16 )
- Detectives are trying to track down the man who opened fire at a college party , hitting five people . NEWLINE
The shooting happened early Sunday morning at an off - campus apartment complex just across the street from Saginaw Valley State University . NEWLINE
All five men who were shot are home recovering . NEWLINE
Witnesses have not been able to give the Saginaw County Sheriff 's Office a solid description of the shooter . NEWLINE
They are only able to describe him as a black man in his 20 's with blonde or orange tipped dreadlocks . NEWLINE
Detectives have gotten some tips , but nothing that has lead to his identity or arrest . NEWLINE
Sheriff Bill Federspiel tells ABC12 that the five men who were shot have not been as cooperative as they could be , so they 're not sure if the shooter and victims knew each other . NEWLINE
There were roughly 1,000 people at the party when the man started shooting . NEWLINE
The five men he hit were not SVSU students , nor did any of them live at the apartment complex . NEWLINE
Even so , the university says it 's time to revisit the safety of its students on and off campus . NEWLINE
The starting point will be to reach out to staff at Campus Village at Cardinal Center ; most of the people who live there are SVSU students . NEWLINE
" We have had ongoing conversations with the owners and the management company of that apartment complex for a number of years .
There 's going to be a renewed emphasis for not only dialogue , but some new procedures to see what we can do in this instance .
Obviously that requires their cooperation , but we are going to see if that cooperation can be achieved , " said J. J. Boem , SVSU spokesman . NEWLINE
Federspiel is trying to set up a meeting with his staff , the University , campus police and Campus Village management . NEWLINE
" There will be changes , I know there will be , " he said . NEWLINE
What changes are still to be discussed . NEWLINE
Campus Village has a private security team that was there the night of the party and they have a contract with the sheriff 's office for patrols . NEWLINE
" The idea is that if individuals see that there 's law enforcement there that maybe they wo n't commit crimes .
Obviously that was n't a deterrent on Sunday morning , " Federspiel said . NEWLINE
Federspiel understands some people question why the party was n't broken up earlier . NEWLINE " It really is n't our place to decide how big of a gathering can occur on private property .
It is our place to enforce it when a property owner says enough is enough , " he said . NEWLINE
Federspiel says neither apartment management nor security made that request Sunday morning . NEWLINE

-- NEWLINE ( 09/11/16 ) - Five men were shot during a party at an off campus apartment complex near Saginaw Valley State University Sunday morning . NEWLINE
All five victims will recover . NEWLINE
They were treated at local hospitals and released within hours of the shooting . NEWLINE
None of the five victims were SVSU students . NEWLINE
The Saginaw County Sheriff 's Office is leading the investigation into what unfolded at Campus Village at Cardinal Center Sunday just before 2 a.m. The apartment complex sits off Pierce Road near Davis Road in Kochville Township . NEWLINE
Sixteen shell casings were found during the investigation .
It 's believed they are all from the same handgun . NEWLINE
Detectives believe the shooter is a black man in his 20 's with blonde or orange tipped dreadlocks . NEWLINE
The shooting victims have n't been much help . NEWLINE
" We 're still hoping the victims will become a little more cooperative than they have been , " said Bill Federspiel , the Saginaw County sheriff . NEWLINE
Federspiel says around a thousand people were at the party when the man opened fire . NEWLINE
" If he 's brazen enough to fire a gun and shoot five people in a crowd of a thousand with a deputy 300 yards away , we need to bring him him , " Federspiel said . NEWLINE
A sheriff 's deputy , contracted to work at the complex , was on property when the shots were fired . NEWLINE
" This shooting occurred even though we had a presence of law enforcement , which is to me , very scary .
The fact that we had uniformed patrol with a marked car on the premise , and this shooting still occurred , is very concerning to me , " Federspiel said . NEWLINE
Detectives do n't know a motive yet . NEWLINE
" Witnesses have told us that the person described as the shooter was overheard stating that he was not happy with some of the people who were at that party , " Federspiel said . NEWLINE
Students describe a very scary situation . NEWLINE
" I was just enjoying the night and then heard three gunshots and everyone just started running , " said Max Amato , a student who was at the party . NEWLINE
" It was all dark so all you could see was like red , like flashes when the gun goes off , " said Aaron Hegarty , an SVSU senior . NEWLINE
Partygoers we talked to say things were fine for most of the night , SVSU celebrating after a big football win over Northwood university . NEWLINE
" It was just a big party .
Everybody was invited , they had D.J. 's set up back here , everybody was dancing .
Then it got to be like
2:00 and then that 's when shots rang out , " said Scott Brown , a student who was at the party .
" It was honestly scary .
It was one of those moments when it was fight or flight .
And everybody just ran . " NEWLINE
When the shots were fired people ran through a courtyard to escape , and even into nearby apartments . NEWLINE
" One of the victims actually walked into the apartment and took his coat and it was just drenched in blood , " said Jaclyn Basso , a student who was at the party .
" I was having a lot of fun and then it happened and now , instantly I do n't feel safe here .
I do n't feel safe walking out of my apartment now
and I just feel really uncomfortable . " NEWLINE
" One of my buddies came and like start pounding on our door , and we did n't know it was him so , that freaked us out , " said Clay Freysinger , an SVSU sophomore . NEWLINE
Students remain concerned that the shooter is on the loose . NEWLINE
" That 's scary that they 're still on the loose and they could be back here next weekend or whenever , so , hoping they catch him soon , " Hegarty said . NEWLINE
The sheriff 's office asks anyone with information about the shooter to call 989 - 790 - 5450 . NEWLINE
