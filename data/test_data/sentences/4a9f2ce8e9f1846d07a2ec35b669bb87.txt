Mottram , responded to a Greater Alarm Structure Fire at 6955 Hayvenhurst Avenue in Van Nuys . NEWLINE
Summoned by a passerby , Firefighters arrived quickly to find smoke showing from the roof of a two - story industrial building , with no evidence of fire alarm activation . NEWLINE
Forcing entry , LAFD crews made their way to the core of the non - fire sprinklered warehouse to discover intense flames in an enclosed storeroom . NEWLINE
Noting the omnipresence of exotic reptiles including snakes within the building , Firefighters commenced a well - coordinated interior fire attack from the east and west with a pair of handlines , allowing them to safely and effectively hold the blaze in check as a mezzanine expectedly collapsed upon itself . NEWLINE
The precise confinement and knockdown of the flames took Firefighters just 25 minutes . NEWLINE
With the fire extinguished , Firefighters deployed powerful ventilation fans at key points around the building to provided large volumes of fresh air to the reptiles , which escaped the fire unscathed . NEWLINE
As the strategic horizontal ventilation cleared smoke from the building , Firefighters noted the presence of a green liquid in water runoff within the structure .
The anomalous liquid was soon determined to be a benign food coloring utilized in the on - site processing of pet food . NEWLINE
No firefighter injuries were reported . NEWLINE
Loss from the blaze is estimated at $ 150,000 ( $ 75,000 structure & $ 75,000 contents ) .
