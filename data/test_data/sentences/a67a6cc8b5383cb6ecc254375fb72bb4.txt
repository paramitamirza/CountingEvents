I do n't understand what happened in this household , but it 's a tragedy that we just ca n't understand . " NEWLINE
Multiple investigators remained at the home and could be seen removing several items .
The body of one of the teens was wheeled out of the home by police and the medical examiner 's office , as neighbors watched in shock .
Police described the neighborhood as a nice residential block in the south end of the city , with well - kept homes . NEWLINE
Neighbor Karen Radtke said she was " horrified and in shock " by the brutal attack . NEWLINE
" This is a quiet neighborhood , " Radtke said .
" This is a very extremely sad situation .

I 'm just in total shock . " NEWLINE

Radtke said she last saw the father Tuesday cutting the grass . NEWLINE
" I 'd see her out there once in awhile , " she said .
" But those kids , they were just normal kids .
Just all playing .
They had a little dog .
The father ?
You 'd never knew he was there until you saw his little car .
It 's just a shame this happened .
How could he do something like this ?
To kill four kids who were just beginning their lives ? " NEWLINE
Radtke and other neighbors said the family just had a birthday celebration last week for one of the youngest children , with balloons and ornaments decorating the house . NEWLINE
" A lot of of their friends and family were here , " Radtke recalled .
"
Her family has to be so devastated .
Let 's hope she makes it .
It 's just so sad . " NEWLINE
A neighbor , who would only identify himself as Jeff , said his wife watched the scene unfold as the father came outside and stood on his porch after apparently killing his family . NEWLINE
" That guy was n't right , " the man said , adding he had a tense disagreement with him six months ago .
" My wife woke me up and said that the police were outside .
She saw him on the porch and she saw them take him away .
I just ca n't believe it all happened .
It had to be premeditated or something .
To kill your own kids , I just can not relate . " NEWLINE

To kill your own kids , I just can not relate . ”
Jeff , Neighbor NEWLINE Neighbor Ronnie Jones said he found out what happened when another neighbor , who lives across the street , called him around 2 a.m. , asking why so many police were outside . NEWLINE
" I went outside and someone told me , ' It 's your neighbor .
He just killed his whole family , ' "
Jones said .
" I 'm shocked .
This never happens on this block .
I 'm shocked because they honestly just seemed like a regular family .
They would have parties and they just had two or three picnic things this summer .
I 've lived here a long time and never saw anything like this . " NEWLINE
