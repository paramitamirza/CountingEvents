Girl , 16 , fatally struck by stray gunfire in Lynwood while returning from church with family
A 16-year - old girl was fatally struck by stray gunfire in Lynwood Wednesday in a gang - related shooting that occurred as she and her family were returning home from church .
The teenager was pronounced dead at the scene after suffering a gunshot wound to her upper torso , according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department .
She was identified by the coroner 's office as Danah Rojo Rivas , a Hawthorne resident .
An investigation by sheriff 's detectives indicated Rivas was riding in the backseat of a vehicle with her white poodle mix on her lap shortly before 9:30 p.m. Her 18-year - old brother was a passenger in the front seat , and her mother was driving , a news release said .
As the family 's vehicle headed eastbound on Euclid Avenue approaching Long Beach Boulevard , " a possible car - to - car shooting or chase was approaching from behind , unbeknownst to them , " the statement said."The intended ' target vehicle ' was trying to get away from the ' suspect vehicle ' but was caught in traffic " at the intersection , according to the sheriff 's department .
A man then exited the " suspect vehicle " and fired several shots at the " target vehicle , " a burgundy Saturn Outlook SUV.Monique Moore and her husband , who live nearby , ducked for cover in their kitchen when they heard the shooting .
Moore later described what she heard to a reporter : " Pow , pow , pow , pow , pow."One of the rounds hit the vehicle carrying Rivas and her family , entering near the rear license plate and striking her from behind , investigators said .
Her mother and brother escaped injury .
The gunman 's vehicle made a U - turn and fled the location , heading westbound on Euclid .
The occupants of the Saturn , two men , abandoned that vehicle and ran away .
Rivas 's mother , realizing her daughter had been shot , pulled over."I just heard the mother or the auntie was screaming , " Moore said , " and I was like , ' Oh my God , they shot somebody 's baby.'"Meanwhile , the frightened dog ran out of the vehicle and into the street , where it was struck and killed by oncoming traffic , the news release said .
Another witness , who gave her name only as Jocelyn , said she too heard the screaming and rushed to Rivas ' side."When I turned her over she just started to spit up blood , " Jocelyn said .
Paramedics responded to the scene and rendered emergency aid to the girl , who succumbed to her injuries."Especially a day before Thanksgiving -- that 's something that , oh my God , no parent wants to go through , " Jocelyn said .
One of the Saturn 's occupants returned to the location ; the other may have gang ties , authorities said .
No detailed description of the shooter or his vehicle was available .
