They added it was too early to tell if the shooting was gang - related . NEWLINE
" These parties go out on Facebook a lot and through Instagram , so that 's how a lot of people end up at the parties , " Bridgeport Police Captain Brian Fitzgerald said .
That 's how we end up with a lot of conflict . " NEWLINE
Ganim asked anyone with any information to contact Bridgeport Police Department at 203 - 576-TIPS. NEWLINE U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the shooting was " more trauma , more tragedy . " NEWLINE
" Every day more Americans are injured or killed by a bullet is more graphic evidence - unwelcome and unwanted - of the urgent need for common sense gun violence prevention measures .
Congress is complicit in this scourge by its inexcusable inaction .
The victims in Bridgeport are among tens of thousands of shooting casualties every year .
No one is immune to this public health crisis as it rips apart communities near and far , " Blumenthal said in a statement on Sunday . NEWLINE
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said the news of shooting in Bridgeport was " infuriating .

I stand with the people of Bridgeport and local law enforcement as they investigate this attempted mass murder and bring the perpetrators to justice .
