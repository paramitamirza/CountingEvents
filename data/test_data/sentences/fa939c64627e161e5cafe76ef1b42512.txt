The 11-year - old told police the children thought the pistol was safe because the ammunition magazine was n't inserted into the hand grip .
However , police believe one round was in the chamber of the weapon , Klementich said .
" We 're going to do a forensic investigation to confirm this , " he said . NEWLINE
Neither of the boys lived at the house .
The pistols they found belonged to an adult resident , police said . NEWLINE
Detectives said two 12-year - old girls were downstairs at the time of the shooting . NEWLINE
" There were some adults present .
The children were getting hungry so ( the adults ) went to a nearby store to pick up some food , " Klementich said .
" When they returned , the adults found the juvenile was deceased . " NEWLINE
Police said the adults and the children will be taken to the HPD headquarters for additional questioning . NEWLINE
" We 're still continuing our investigation and we 'll present the facts to the District Attorney 's Office , " which will determine whether charges are justified , Klementich said . NEWLINE
Under Texas law , making a firearm accessible to a child is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail . NEWLINE
Over the last eight years , 14 people have been charged in Harris County for failing to secure a firearm . NEWLINE
