Boy , 5 , shot with shotgun by older brother in Humble area
A five - year - old boy was airlifted to a hospital after he was shot with a shotgun in the Humble area .
The shooting happened at a retention pond in the 200 block of Moonshine Hill .
Harris County deputies say two brothers -- ages five and 11-- were playing by themselves ; they had a shotgun and somehow , the younger brother was shot near his face and neck .
Neighbors filled in the gaps , telling us the boys often go dove hunting .
This time , their parents were left at home .
The older brother got into the water - but the younger boy went back to get the gun and accidentally shot himself .
Neighbors then say the 11-year - old tried to save his brother , desperately getting the attention of neighbors for help .
Neighbors say the 11-year - old , who was questioned by detectives long after his brother was airlifted away , used an emergency vehicle to drive to a nearby home to find an adult to help .
The boy is in critical but stable condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital .
An investigation is ongoing .
