Girl is third teen hit by stray bullet this week
A 16-year - old girl who was shot while walking down her Juniata Park street Wednesday night was the third juvenile victim of a stray - bullet shooting in four days , according to police . NEWLINE
Lt .
John Stanford , police spokesman , urged anyone with information on the shootings , all unsolved , to come forward . NEWLINE
" If a child is shot and we as adults do n't speak up for those kids , then we are essentially not protecting our future , " he said . NEWLINE
The teen girl , who was shot in her thigh , was listed in stable condition at St. Christopher 's Hospital for Children .
Police did not release her name . NEWLINE
According to police , the teen was walking with a female friend around 10:45 p.m. when they saw a minivan pull into an alley behind the Brito Mini Market at the corner of O and Lycoming streets . NEWLINE
The pair watched as a man on foot approached the van , pulled a gun from his waistband and fired two shots into the vehicle , police said . NEWLINE
The gunman walked away after the shooting , the driver of the minivan sped off and the girl ran to a neighbor 's house , where she realized she had been shot , according to police . NEWLINE
Authorities are investigating whether a bullet or bullet fragment ricocheted off of the van and struck the girl or whether the bullet went through the vehicle and hit her . NEWLINE
Shortly after the teen was taken to St. Christopher 's , a 22-year - old man with a gunshot wound to his chest was dropped off by a minivan at Aria Health 's Frankford campus , police said . NEWLINE
That victim , who is believed to have been the intended target of the shooting , remains in critical condition .
The driver of the van tried to flee the hospital but police were able to stop him nearby . NEWLINE
The motive for the shooting remains unknown and the shooter remains on the loose as do the shooters in two other cases where teens were injured by stray bullets this week . NEWLINE
A 13-year - old boy who was playing outside on the 4300 block of North Darien Street in Hunting Park around 11:24 p.m. Wednesday was hit twice by stray bullets when a man got of a car and fired eight times .

Authorities did , however , announce an arrest in the case of a 14-year - old girl who was accidentally shot in the chest and hand by her friend early Wednesday morning in East Germantown . NEWLINE

Fauntleroy has been charged with aggravated assault and related offenses .
The girl remains in stable condition at St. Christopher 's . NEWLINE
" I do n't think there 's a rhyme or reason or some calculated explanation as to why these kids fell victim to gunfire , " Stanford said .
" I think it all boils down to too many guns being out on the street . " NEWLINE
