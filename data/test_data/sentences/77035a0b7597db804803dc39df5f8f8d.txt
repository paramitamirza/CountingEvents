Ibaraki clinic ‘ named and shamed’ for maternity harassment
The labor ministry on Friday made public the name of a dermatology clinic in Ibaraki Prefecture that it says defied numerous instructions not to dismiss an employee on the grounds of her pregnancy .
Ushiku Hifuka Iin ( Ushiku Dermatology Clinic ) , located in the city of Ushiku , became the nation ’s first institution to be publicly named as a violator of Article 9 of the Equal Employment Opportunities Law , which bans employers from acts of “ maternity harassment , ” or firing or demoting employees due to pregnancy or childbirth .
The policy of naming and shaming the law ’s violators has been in place since April 2009 , a ministry official said , noting it will continue to urge the clinic to comply with the law .
According to the ministry , the dermatology clinic , run by Dr. Isamu Yasuraoka , dismissed a full - time employee working as a nursing assistant after the woman became pregnant earlier this year .
The Ibaraki Labor Bureau received her complaint and urged the clinic to rescind the action , first verbally in March , then twice in writing later in March and in May. When that failed to elicit a response , the Health , Labor and Welfare Ministry itself issued a formal letter in July urging the clinic to rectify the situation .
The clinic ignored the communications from the labor bureau and the ministry , finally telling a ministry official who called the clinic that it had “ no intention of following ” the instruction .
Phone calls to the clinic went unanswered Friday , with a recorded message saying it has been closed due to the ill health of its director , and that it remains unclear when the practice will resume .
According to a 2014 online survey by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation ( better known as Rengo ) , of 634 female workers across the country in their 20s , 30s and 40s , 26.3 percent of respondents said they had experienced maternity harassment , while 27.3 percent said they knew victims of this type of harassment in their workplaces .
