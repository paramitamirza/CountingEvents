In the quiet of a predawn Saturday on a dead - end street , a father came home and shot his family in their heads , leaving women in three generations dead and a wounded 12-year - old girl calling 911 , police said . NEWLINE
" What I did , I can not come back from , " Jonathon Walker told his brother by phone soon afterward , police said .
And Walker did not come back —
police said he killed himself in his car on a desolate street a few miles away , ending a burst of violence that stunned relatives who said the family had n't shown signs of trouble . NEWLINE
The 34-year - old security guard had killed his 7-year - old daughter , Kayla Walker ; his 31-year - old girlfriend , Shantai Hale ; and Hale 's mother , Viola Warren , 62 .
His and Hale 's older daughter , whom a relative identified as Christina Walker , was hospitalized in stable condition , police said . NEWLINE
Investigators were trying to trace Walker 's movements before the shooting as relatives struggled to comprehend shootings that struck them as inexplicable . NEWLINE
" I ca n't believe this happened .
I ca n't believe this happened , " Doreen Warren , the eldest victim 's mother , sobbed by phone . NEWLINE
While Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said police had taken reports for domestic incidents at the home in 2005 and 2006 for " nominal matters " and Walker had been arrested twice in now - sealed cases , relatives said they were n't aware of any family strife or concerns about Walker . NEWLINE
" There was no indication of anything that would remotely make him do this , " Wendell Warren , Viola Warren 's brother , said as he wiped tears from his eyes outside the home on a suburban - style street in Queens , near a park and John F. Kennedy International Airport .
Warren had fixed a broken boiler at the home just last week . NEWLINE
" We 'll be baffled for years , " he said . NEWLINE
Doreen Warren said Walker had joined in a pleasant family gathering at Christmas and her daughter and granddaughter never complained to her about him .
She said she had spoken to Viola Warren , who worked at the airport , just two days ago . NEWLINE
" Nobody even dreamed of anything like this , " added Silford Warren , another of Viola Warren 's brothers . NEWLINE
The bloody scene unfolded suddenly and quickly —
Walker showed up to the home at 5:38 a.m. , and his 12-year - old daughter called 911 a few minutes afterward to report , in slurred words , that her father had shot the family , Boyce said .
When officers arrived three minutes later , Walker was gone . NEWLINE
They searched for his SUV and found it within hours , with Walker 's body and a .45-caliber gun inside , Boyce said . NEWLINE
The victims were found on the home 's floor , he said . NEWLINE
Christina underwent surgery later Saturday , but " she 's always tough .
She 's determined to live , " Wendell Warren said .
His mother called Christina and her slain sister " two beautiful girls , sweet girls . " NEWLINE
As police sought Walker , Doreen Walker woke up at her home elsewhere in New York City .
She turned on the TV to hear violent news , and then had the shock of realizing it concerned her own family . NEWLINE
" You see these things on television , " she said , " and you never know when they 're going to hit home . " NEWLINE
