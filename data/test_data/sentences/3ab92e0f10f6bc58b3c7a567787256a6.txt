" The car was already here at 9:30 , " Bronson said .
" And I just thought it was a broke - down car . " NEWLINE
Bronson , who spends Thursday through Sunday at his property near the southeastern edges of Collier County , said he passed the car in his swamp buggy when he left to help a friend install a part on his buggy .
As he passed it , he could see somebody sitting in the driver 's seat . NEWLINE
" I looked in and I could see it looked like a woman , " he said .
" I thought she was sleeping . " NEWLINE
When he returned about 10:45 a.m. , Bronson got his mail from his mailbox about two car lengths away from where the Malibu was parked .
He decided to take a closer look at the car . NEWLINE
" It 's been several hours , I figured they 'd been sleeping , they should go wake up by now , " Bronson said .
" I went and knocked on the window , and there was no movement .
So I looked inside
and I could see that there was something bad wrong , you know , I could see blood .
So I knew something was wrong . " NEWLINE
Bronson then called 911 . NEWLINE
" They wanted to make sure that they were n't sleeping , and I said , ' No , this do n't look good , ' " he said . NEWLINE
Bronson said deputies told him there were two dead people in the back seat in addition to the dead woman he saw sitting in the driver 's seat .
He said he could n't see the bodies in the back because of the car 's tinted windows . NEWLINE
" They said it 's a Miami car , " he said , adding that he told dispatchers the car 's tag . NEWLINE
Cars breaking down by the side of the road is n't uncommon in the remote area near Ochopee , Bronson said . NEWLINE
" All kinds of things happen out here like that , " he said .
" Flat tires and overheating , but this here was the first time we ever had anything like this . " NEWLINE
On Thursday afternoon , more than a dozen cars and trucks from the Sheriff 's Office and the crime scene investigation department lined the road .
U.S. 41 remained open but was down to one lane . NEWLINE
Deputies wearing reflective neon yellow vests directed traffic , with orange cones and yellow tape cordoning off the side of the road where the car was parked . NEWLINE
Investigators searched the sides of U.S. 41 with metal detectors and canvassed the wooded area behind the blue tent that covered the black Chevy where the bodies were found . NEWLINE
A Sheriff 's Office helicopter circled overhead as classic rock played from a radio on Bronson 's property . NEWLINE
" I 'm from Miami , , " Bronson said .
" It happens like this all the time in Miami .
But out here , it was , you know , hate to see it out here . " NEWLINE
