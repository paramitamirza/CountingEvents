Said Commissioner William Evans : “
When a young man with his whole life ahead of him gets gunned down in broad daylight , finding those responsible is of the highest priority to the men and women of the Boston Police Department .
Clearly , in the case of Raekwon Brown , those responsible cared little about who they hurt or what lives were ruined on that fateful day .
To the Raekwon ’s family , again , I can only hope that the news of today ’s third arrest brings with it some small measure of comfort and solace .
To my detectives , I want to commend them for the around - the - clock efforts that lead to today ’s arrest .
Thanks to their perseverance and determination , the suspect arrested today is no longer in a position to hurt or harm in anyone else in our community .
