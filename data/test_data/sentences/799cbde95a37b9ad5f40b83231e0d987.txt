Boy found gun in closet , according to reports
 Reports released Monday by the Routt County Sheriff 's Office detail how 3-year - old Gavin Stiles got access to his father 's gun and fatally shot himself . NEWLINE
On the morning of July 14 , Michael Stiles , Gavin 's father and a Steamboat Springs police officer , was building a deck outside his home in the Stagecoach area with two construction workers . NEWLINE
Gavin 's mother , Joni Stiles , was upstairs and had just put Gavin ’s 6-month - old brother in the den and was talking to her father on the phone when she heard a loud " bang . " NEWLINE
Joni Stiles thought something had fallen in the den , and she went to check on the 6-month - old .
After seeing he was fine , Joni Stiles ran downstairs and saw Gavin on the floor of the master bedroom . NEWLINE
Joni Stiles told deputies that she " immediately knew . "
She picked up Gavin and brought him to his father and yelled that Gavin had shot himself . NEWLINE
Gavin was conscious , and Michael Stiles applied direct pressure to the wound .
A construction worker , who is a trained emergency medical technician , rushed Gavin and Michael Stiles toward Steamboat , where they met an ambulance near the entrance to Lake Catamount . NEWLINE
Before going to the hospital , Joni Stiles went back in the master bedroom .
She saw a gun and a bag on the floor . NEWLINE
At the hospital , deputies interviewed Michael Stiles .
He said all the guns in the house had been " put up . " NEWLINE
" If he was in my room , he climbed up in the closet and pulled my bag down , " Michael Stiles told investigators . NEWLINE
He said the bag contained items he needed to respond to an emergency , including a .45-caliber , semi - automatic Glock issued to him by the police department . NEWLINE
Michael Stiles guessed that Gavin could have climbed a dresser or another piece of furniture to access the bag . NEWLINE
Steamboat Police Chief Cory Christensen on Tuesday said it was not unusual for police officers to keep their guns loaded when they are stored . NEWLINE
On Thursday , members of a grand jury that met in secret to review the case decided not to indict Joni or Michael Stiles . NEWLINE
With the criminal process now complete , a sergeant at the police department has been assigned to determine if any policies were violated . NEWLINE
Michael Stiles requested a six - month , unpaid leave of absence after the shooting . NEWLINE
The police department 's policy manual specifically addresses how officers should store their firearms at home .
It states : " Members shall ensure that all firearms and ammunition are locked and secured while in their homes , vehicles or any other area under their control , and in a manner that will keep them inaccessible to children and others who should not have access . " NEWLINE
Christensen said that is a standard policy , and he thinks it is clear . NEWLINE
" I do n't think I can think of a better way of saying that , " Christensen said . NEWLINE
He said the policy has been discussed at length with all the officers at the department . NEWLINE
" A sensitive topic but important for us to talk about , " Christensen said . NEWLINE
